<h1>Roofing Minimum Age Requirement</h1>
<p>Roofing workers, whether employees or subcontractors, must be over 18 years of age. Youth less than 18 years old are prohibited from doing roof work, including ground helpers. This is Federal and state law. There is typically an exemption if the youth is in a valid work apprenticeship program for roofing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Code of Virginia</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>ยง 40.1-100. Certain employment prohibited or limited.</li>
  <li>A. No child under 18 years of age shall be employed, permitted, or suffered to work:</li>
  <li>6. In any capacity in or about excavation, demolition, <u>roofing</u>, wrecking, or shipbreaking operations;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Fact Sheet #74</strong></h2>
<p>The Employment of Youth in Roofing Occupations and On Roofs under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) - more information can be found in the full document linked below but here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hazardous Occupations Order No. 16 (HO 16), generally prohibits minors less than 18 years from employment in any roofing occupation-on a roof as well as on the ground-as well as any work requiring the youth to work on or about a roof.</li>
  <li>The term roofing occupations means all work performed in connection with the installation of roofs, including related metal work such as flashing, and applying weatherproofing materials and substances (such as waterproof membranes, tar, slag or pitch, asphalt prepared paper, tile, composite roofing materials, slate, metal, translucent materials, and shingles of asbestos, asphalt, wood or other materials) to roofs of buildings or other structures. The term also includes all jobs on the ground related to roofing operations such as roofing laborer, roofing helper, materials handler and tending a tar heater</li>
  <li>The rules allow 16- and 17-year-olds who are employed pursuant to a valid apprenticeship or student-learner program to perform work that would otherwise be prohibited.</li>
  <li>When state child labor laws differ from the federal provisions, an employer must comply with the higher standard.</li>
</ul>
