If you have any question that you do not see addressed here, please email HR@cenvarroofing.com

**How do I request time off?** You should request all time off with your General Manager. For General Managers, please request time off with your Regional Manager. [Time Off, Paid Holidays, Sick Days Policy](/i/43)

**I have a problem with my paycheck. What do I do?** Please email [HR@cenvarroofing.com](mailto:HR@cenvarroofing.com)

**I did not sign up for Health Insurance when I was hired. Can I sign up now?** Unfortunately, you can only sign up for insurance benefits within the first 60 days of employment. However, a change in your situation — like getting married, having a baby, or losing health coverage could possibly make you eligible for a Special Enrollment Period, allowing you to enroll in health insurance outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period. If you rejected benefits when you were hired, you must wait until the next open enrollment (March).
