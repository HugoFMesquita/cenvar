<p><strong>I did not sign up for Health Insurance when I was hired. Can I sign up now?</strong> Unfortunately, you can only sign up for insurance benefits within the first 60 days of employment. However, a&nbsp;change&nbsp;in your situation â€” like getting married, having a baby, or losing&nbsp;health coverage&nbsp;could possibly make you eligible for a Special Enrollment Period, allowing you to enroll in&nbsp;health insurance&nbsp;outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period. If you rejected benefits when you were hired, you must wait until the next open enrollment (March).</p>
