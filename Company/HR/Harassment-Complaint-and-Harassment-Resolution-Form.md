## **As per the** [**_Cenvar Roofing Employee Handbook_**](/manuals/employee-handbook.-2021-1.pdf):

Cenvar will not tolerate any form of harassment of its employees. All complaints of harassment will be thoroughly investigated and disciplinary or corrective action will be taken as warranted. Retaliation against employees who file complaints of harassment is prohibited; however, such protection does not condone baseless or vindictive accusations of others.
