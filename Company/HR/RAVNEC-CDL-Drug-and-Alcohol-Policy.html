<h1><strong>RAVNEC Drug &amp; Alcohol Policy for CDL Drivers</strong></h1>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>Published 09/12/2024</i></span></p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>It is the policy of <strong>RAVNEC LLC</strong> (herein referred to as the “Company”) that the use, sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one’s system of any controlled substance (except medically prescribed drugs) by any employee while on the Company’s premises, engaged in Company business, operating Company equipment, or while under the authority of the Company is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company further maintains a policy that the unauthorized use, sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one’s system of alcohol or any other intoxicating agent by any employee while on the Company’s premises, engaged in Company business, operating Company equipment, or while under the authority of the Company is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons why we have implemented a drug and alcohol testing program, they include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deterring employees from abusing alcohol and drugs.</li>
  <li>Preventing hiring individuals who use illegal drugs.</li>
  <li>Identifying early in order to appropriately refer employees who have drug and/or alcohol problems.</li>
  <li>Providing a safe workplace for employees.</li>
  <li>Protecting the general public and instilling consumer confidence that employees are working safely.</li>
  <li>Workers’ Compensation Premium and Group Discount programs.</li>
  <li>Complying with state, federal and local laws and regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aspects of the Company’s operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, therefore certain Company employees are subject to the terms and conditions of this RAVNEC Drug and Alcohol Policy. The serious impact of drug use and alcohol abuse has been recognized by the federal government. Consequently, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMSCA) has issued regulations which require the Company to enhance its alcohol and controlled substance program.</p>
<p>It is the Company’s intent that the policies and procedures in this RAVNEC Drug and Alcohol Policy be consistent with provisions contained in the Employee Handbook. In the unlikely event that the terms of this drug and alcohol policy conflict with any provision contained in the Employee Handbook, the terms and conditions of this drug and alcohol policy shall control. Violation of any provision contained in this drug and alcohol policy shall be deemed a violation of the Company’s overall drug and alcohol policy and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NEITHER THIS POLICY NOR ANY OF ITS TERMS ARE INTENDED TO CREATE A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR CONTAIN THE TERMS OF ANY CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT. THE COMPANY RETAINS THE SOLE RIGHT TO CHANGE, AMEND, OR MODIFY ANY TERM OR PROVISION OF THIS POLICY WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY REGULATIONS (FMCSR) SET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING OF SAFETY SENSITIVE EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY’S POLICY IN CERTAIN INSTANCES MAY BE MORE OR LESS STRINGENT FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>For More Information About DOT Requirements or Our Company Policy:</strong></p>
<p>Contact the Company’s Safety Representative, Ken Latimer, at 434-942-2267. The Company’s Designated Employer Representative (DER) is Kim Martin, who can be reached at 540-739-0154.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>This policy is in effect on an employee’s hiring date.</p>
<h2><strong>Confidentiality/Record-keeping</strong></h2>
<p>All employee drug and alcohol test records are considered confidential. For the purpose of this policy/procedure, confidential recordkeeping is defined as records maintained in a secure manner, under lock and key, accessible only to designated employees.</p>
<p>Employee alcohol and controlled substance test records will only be released in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To the active employee, upon their request.</li>
  <li>Upon written consent by the employee authorizing the release to a specified individual.</li>
  <li>Upon request of a DOT agency with regulatory authority over the Company.</li>
  <li>Upon request of state or local officials with regulatory authority over the Company.</li>
  <li>Upon request of the United States Secretary of Transportation.</li>
  <li>Upon request by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of an accident investigation.</li>
  <li>In a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding when legally applicable.</li>
  <li>Upon request by subsequent employers upon receipt of a written request by an employee.</li>
  <li>Positives and refusals will be reported to the DOT recognized National Drug &amp; Alcohol Clearinghouse for truck and bus drivers.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Employee Categories Subject To Testing</strong></h2>
<p>This drug and alcohol policy applies to commercial delivery drivers who are required to have a commercial driver’s license (CDL) and who operate a commercial motor vehicle as defined in Part 382 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not required to have a CDL, or you do not operate commercial motor vehicles, refer to the Employee Handbook.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Drug &amp; Alcohol Prohibitions</strong></h2>
<p>Employees are strictly prohibited from engaging in the following activities:</p>
<p><strong>Drug Prohibitions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use of any controlled substance, except when administered by, or under the instructions of, a licensed medical practitioner, who has advised the employee that the substance will not affect the employee’s ability to perform a safety-sensitive function. Be advised that the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is not a legitimate explanation. Under federal law, the use of marijuana does not have a legitimate medical use in the United States.</li>
  <li>All testing is conducted according to SAMHSA’s guidelines and checks for a <i><strong>5-Panel</strong></i> of illicit drugs, plus alcohol (ethanol, ethyl alcohol, booze). These five illicit drugs are:<ul>
      <li>Amphetamines (meth, speed, crank, ecstasy)</li>
      <li>THC (cannabinoids, marijuana, hash)</li>
      <li>Cocaine (coke, crack)</li>
      <li>Opiates (heroin, opium, codeine, morphine)</li>
      <li>Phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the company is not limited in the number of substances they can test for and may include drugs that individuals legitimately and/or therapeutically take based on a physician’s prescription. Although most private employers can test for any combination of drugs, there are commonly selected “panels.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The typical <i><strong>8-Panel</strong> Test</i> includes the above-mentioned substances plus:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Barbiturates (phenobarbital, butalbital, secobarbital, downers)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Benzodiazepines (tranquilizers like Valium, Librium, Xanax)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Methaqualone (Quaaludes)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The typical <i><strong>10-Panel</strong> Test</i> includes the 8-Panel Test plus:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Methadone (often used to treat heroin addiction)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Propoxyphene (Darvon compounds)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Testing can also be done for:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Hallucinogens (LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, peyote)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Inhalants (paint, glue, hairspray)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Anabolic steroids (synthesized, muscle-building hormones)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Hydrocodone (prescription medication known as Lortab, Vicodin, Oxycodone)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one’s system of any controlled substance (except medically prescribed drugs) by any employee while on the Company’s premises, engaged in Company business, operating Company equipment, or while under the authority of the Company.</li>
  <li>Testing positive for a controlled substance (except medically prescribed drugs).</li>
  <li>Refusal to submit to a post-accident, random, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or follow-up drug test.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alcohol Prohibitions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reporting for duty or remaining on duty in a position requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of <strong>.04</strong> or greater.</li>
  <li>Consumption of alcohol in any form while performing safety-sensitive functions.</li>
  <li>Performance of any safety-sensitive function within 4 hours after consuming alcohol.</li>
  <li>Refusal to take a required alcohol test.</li>
  <li>Consumption of alcohol for 8 hours after an accident unless the employee has been given a post-accident test. This applies to employees with knowledge of an accident involving a commercial motor vehicle operating on a public road in commerce for which they performed a safety-sensitive function at or near the time of the accident.</li>
  <li>Refusal to submit to a post-accident, random, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or follow-up alcohol test.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Alcohol</i> is defined as the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohols, including methyl or isopropyl alcohol.</li>
  <li><i>Alcohol use</i> is defined as the consumption of any beverage, mixture, or preparation, including any medication (prescribed or over-the-counter, intentional or unintentional), containing alcohol.</li>
  <li><i>Covered Employee</i> shall include all active employees of the Company who are subject to the terms and conditions of this drug and alcohol policy. Acknowledgement of receipt of this drug and alcohol policy shall be indication that the employee is subject to the policy.</li>
  <li><i>Safety-Sensitive Functions</i> shall include:&nbsp;(1) all time spent at a distributor warehouse, other property, or on any public property, waiting to be dispatched, unless the employee has been relieved from duty by his or her supervisor; (2) all time spent inspecting, servicing, or conditioning any motor vehicle at any time; (3) all time spent at the driving controls of a motor vehicle in operation; (4) all time, other than driving time, in or upon any motor vehicle; (5) all time loading or unloading a vehicle, supervising, or assisting in the loading or unloading, attending a vehicle being loaded or unloaded, remaining in readiness to operate the vehicle, or in giving or receiving receipts for shipments loaded or unloaded; and (6) all time fueling, repairing, obtaining assistance, or remaining in attendance upon a disabled vehicle.</li>
  <li><i>FMCSA Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse</i>, aka, Clearinghouse is a secure online database that gives employers, the FMCSA, State Driver Licensing Agencies (SDLAs), and state law enforcement personnel real-time information about commercial driver’s license (CDL) and commercial learner’s permit (CLP) holders’ drug and alcohol program violations. An act of Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to establish the Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse enables employers to identify drivers who commit a drug and alcohol program violation while working for one employer, but who fail to subsequently inform another employer (as required by current regulations).</li>
  <li><i>General Applicability:</i> An employee is considered to be performing a safety-sensitive function during any period in which he or she is actually performing, ready to perform, or immediately available to perform any and all functions described or related to these described here.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Types of Drug &amp; Alcohol Testing</strong></h2>
<p>Employees may be subject to each of the following types of drug and alcohol tests:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Employment (drug only)</strong></p>
<p>Employees shall be subject to a drug test prior to employment. No employee shall be permitted to perform any safety-sensitive function, including the driving of any company vehicle, until they have received a negative drug test result.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Accident</strong></p>
<p>In the event of an accident involving a commercial motor vehicle operating on a public road in commerce, the involved employee shall be subject to a drug and alcohol test in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the accident involved the loss of human life.</li>
  <li>If the employee receives a citation for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident, and the accident involves either:<ul>
      <li>Bodily injury to any person who immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or</li>
      <li>One or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage requiring the motor vehicle to be transported away from the scene by tow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Random</strong></p>
<p>Employees shall be subject to random drug and alcohol testing. Random testing will be conducted without notice to randomly selected employees. Employees may be grouped into drug and alcohol testing pools based on job function, safety sensitive drivers must be in a separate pool and could include a mechanic with a CDL. All employees within each pool have an equal chance of testing.</p>
<p><strong>Reasonable Suspicion</strong></p>
<p>Employees shall be subject to reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol testing if a trained supervisor or trained company official believes or suspects that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol (or both).</p>
<p><strong>Return-to-Duty &amp; Follow-Up</strong></p>
<p>Employees retained by the Company after a positive test result or a test refusal shall be subject to return-to-duty drug and alcohol testing. No employee shall be permitted to perform any safety-sensitive function until they have received a verified negative drug and alcohol test result. Thereafter, such employees will be subject to certain follow-up drug and alcohol testing as established by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP).</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Drug Testing Procedures</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A DOT drug testing Chain of Custody Form (CCF) (both printed or E-chain/E-CCF) will be used to document the chain of custody from the time the specimen is collected at the testing facility until it is tested at the laboratory.</li>
  <li>Before you proceed to a predetermined testing clinic to provide your drug and/or alcohol test specimen, you will be provided a pre-generated testing “passport” with instructions and information for the clinic. This will be given to you either electronically by email or text message, or you will receive a hard copy. The clinic must scan your passport to initiate the testing process, so you must have your passport available when you arrive</li>
  <li>The collection of the specimen must be conducted in a suitable location and must contain all necessary personnel, materials, equipment, facilities, and supervision to provide for collection, security, and temporary storage and transportation of the specimen to a certified laboratory.</li>
  <li>The employee should have and present positive identification to the collector. The employee may also request positive identification of the collection site employee.</li>
  <li>The employee must provide a specimen meeting the specified volume and temperature requirements.</li>
  <li>All identifying information must be entered on the CCF by the collection site person. The CCF will be signed by the collector, certifying collection was accomplished in accordance with the instructions provided. The employee must also sign the CCF indicating the specimen was his/hers.</li>
  <li>A urinalysis will be performed by a laboratory certified by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) that has been retained by the Company. The laboratory will be required to maintain strict compliance with federally-approved chain-of-custody procedures, quality control, maintenance, and scientific analytical methodologies.</li>
  <li>The laboratory must report all test results directly to the Company’s designated MRO, who is responsible for reviewing and interpreting all confirmed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid drug test results. The MRO must determine whether alternative medical explanations could account for the test results. The MRO must also give the employee who has a positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid drug test an opportunity to discuss the results prior to making a final determination. After the decision is made, the MRO must notify the Company’s DER.</li>
  <li>An employee who receives a positive, adulterated, or substituted drug test result has 72 hours to request the test of the split specimen (which is provided at the time of original collection). If the employee requests the testing of the split, the MRO must direct (in writing) the lab to provide the split specimen to another certified laboratory for analysis. The employee will pay for the testing of the split specimen.</li>
