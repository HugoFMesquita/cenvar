<h1><strong>RAVNEC Drug &amp; Alcohol Policy for CDL Drivers</strong></h1>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>Published 09/12/2024</i></span></p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>It is the policy of <strong>RAVNEC LLC</strong> (herein referred to as the “Company”) that the use, sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one’s system of any controlled substance (except medically prescribed drugs) by any employee while on the Company’s premises, engaged in Company business, operating Company equipment, or while under the authority of the Company is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company further maintains a policy that the unauthorized use, sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one’s system of alcohol or any other intoxicating agent by any employee while on the Company’s premises, engaged in Company business, operating Company equipment, or while under the authority of the Company is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons why we have implemented a drug and alcohol testing program, they include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deterring employees from abusing alcohol and drugs.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Preventing hiring individuals who use illegal drugs.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Identifying early in order to appropriately refer employees who have drug and/or alcohol problems.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Providing a safe workplace for employees.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Protecting the general public and instilling consumer confidence that employees are working safely.</li>
  <li>Workers’ Compensation Premium and Group Discount programs.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Complying with state, federal and local laws and regulations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Aspects of the Company’s operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, therefore certain Company employees are subject to the terms and conditions of this RAVNEC Drug and Alcohol Policy. The serious impact of drug use and alcohol abuse has been recognized by the federal government. Consequently, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMSCA) has issued regulations which require the Company to enhance its alcohol and controlled substance program.</p>
<p>It is the Company’s intent that the policies and procedures in this RAVNEC Drug and Alcohol Policy be consistent with provisions contained in the Employee Handbook. In the unlikely event that the terms of this drug and alcohol policy conflict with any provision contained in the Employee Handbook, the terms and conditions of this drug and alcohol policy shall control. Violation of any provision contained in this drug and alcohol policy shall be deemed a violation of the Company’s overall drug and alcohol policy and will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NEITHER THIS POLICY NOR ANY OF ITS TERMS ARE INTENDED TO CREATE A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT OR CONTAIN THE TERMS OF ANY CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT. THE COMPANY RETAINS THE SOLE RIGHT TO CHANGE, AMEND, OR MODIFY ANY TERM OR PROVISION OF THIS POLICY WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY REGULATIONS (FMCSR) SET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING OF SAFETY SENSITIVE EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY’S POLICY IN CERTAIN INSTANCES MAY BE MORE OR LESS STRINGENT FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>For More Information About DOT Requirements or Our Company Policy:</strong></p>
<p>Contact the Company’s Safety Representative, Ken Latimer, at 434-942-2267. The Company’s Designated Employer Representative (DER) is Kim Martin, who can be reached at 540-739-0154.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>This policy is in effect on an employee’s hiring date.</p>
<h2><strong>Confidentiality/Record-keeping</strong></h2>
<p>All employee drug and alcohol test records are considered confidential. For the purpose of this policy/procedure, confidential recordkeeping is defined as records maintained in a secure manner, under lock and key, accessible only to designated employees.</p>
<p>Employee alcohol and controlled substance test records will only be released in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To the active employee, upon their request.</li>
  <li>Upon written consent by the employee authorizing the release to a specified individual.</li>
  <li>Upon request of a DOT agency with regulatory authority over the Company.</li>
  <li>Upon request of state or local officials with regulatory authority over the Company.</li>
  <li>Upon request of the United States Secretary of Transportation.</li>
  <li>Upon request by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of an accident investigation.</li>
  <li>In a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding when legally applicable.</li>
  <li>Upon request by subsequent employers upon receipt of a written request by an employee.</li>
  <li>Positives and refusals will be reported to the DOT recognized National Drug &amp; Alcohol Clearinghouse for truck and bus drivers.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Employee Categories Subject To Testing</strong></h2>
<p>This drug and alcohol policy applies to commercial delivery drivers who are required to have a commercial driver’s license (CDL) and who operate a commercial motor vehicle as defined in Part 382 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not required to have a CDL, or you do not operate commercial motor vehicles, refer to the Employee Handbook.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Drug &amp; Alcohol Prohibitions</strong></h2>
<p>Employees are strictly prohibited from engaging in the following activities:</p>
<p><strong>Drug Prohibitions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use of any controlled substance, except when administered by, or under the instructions of, a licensed medical practitioner, who has advised the employee that the substance will not affect the employee’s ability to perform a safety-sensitive function. Be advised that the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is not a legitimate explanation. Under federal law, the use of marijuana does not have a legitimate medical use in the United States.</li>
  <li>All testing is conducted according to SAMHSA’s guidelines and checks for a <i><strong>5-Panel</strong></i> of illicit drugs, plus alcohol (ethanol, ethyl alcohol, booze). These five illicit drugs are:<ul>
      <li>Amphetamines (meth, speed, crank, ecstasy)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>THC (cannabinoids, marijuana, hash)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Cocaine (coke, crack)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Opiates (heroin, opium, codeine, morphine)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust)&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>However, the company is not limited in the number of substances they can test for and may include drugs that individuals legitimately and/or therapeutically take based on a physician’s prescription. Although most private employers can test for any combination of drugs, there are commonly selected “panels.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The typical <i><strong>8-Panel</strong> Test</i> includes the above-mentioned substances plus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Barbiturates (phenobarbital, butalbital, secobarbital, downers)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Benzodiazepines (tranquilizers like Valium, Librium, Xanax)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Methaqualone (Quaaludes)</li>
</ul>
<p>The typical <i><strong>10-Panel</strong> Test</i> includes the 8-Panel Test plus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Methadone (often used to treat heroin addiction)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Propoxyphene (Darvon compounds)</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing can also be done for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hallucinogens (LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, peyote)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Inhalants (paint, glue, hairspray)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Anabolic steroids (synthesized, muscle-building hormones)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Hydrocodone (prescription medication known as Lortab, Vicodin, Oxycodone)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or presence in one’s system of any controlled substance (except medically prescribed drugs) by any employee while on the Company’s premises, engaged in Company business, operating Company equipment, or while under the authority of the Company.</li>
  <li>Testing positive for a controlled substance (except medically prescribed drugs).</li>
  <li>Refusal to submit to a post-accident, random, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or follow-up drug test.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
