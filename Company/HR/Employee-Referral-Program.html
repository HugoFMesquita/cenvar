<p>The enterprise as a whole strives to find and hire the best talent available â€” employees who exude our values and choose to contribute to our company goals. We believe that our existing employees, who already meet these criteria, are in a great position to help us find the best candidates. We recognize that current employees are likely to refer only those individuals best suited to work at our company, and therefore we wish to reward them for their referral efforts.</p>
<p><strong><u>Positions:</u></strong><br>We accept employee referrals for any open position listed on our company job board. We also welcome referrals for highly skilled individuals who may not match up exactly with a posted job. To make a referral, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16q_m8BAJJy5v32qjb6oI4ruxfMjfvrI0opDlWNOeWkg/edit">Employee Referral</a> form must be used.<br><br><strong><u>Incentives &amp; Rules:&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>$1,500 for any referral submitted who is hired by the Company and remains in their position for a minimum of 6 months.</li>
  <li>You must submit the candidate to HR using our internal form.</li>
  <li>You must be an employee in good standing at the time of submission and upon payout of any incentive.</li>
  <li>You must not be the hiring manager or a member of the HR department directly associated with hiring the candidate.</li>
  <li>The job must be posted on Indeed, LinkedIn, Zip Recruiter, etc. and they must apply to the posting.</li>
  <li>Once your referral is hired you will be added to HR's calendar to be paid out your referral bonus once your referral has been with the company for 6 months.</li>
</ul>
