<h1><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This employee handbook has been prepared to help you become familiar with some of the policies of Good’s Construction Co., LLC, doing business as Cenvar Roofing (“the Company”) concerning your employment.&nbsp;The handbook is not intended to be a complete statement of all Company policies.&nbsp; From time to time, circumstances might require management to modify or revise these policies, and policies may be communicated to you orally or through other written notices.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The handbook is not an express or implied employment contract. Your employment is “at will.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Because employment with the Company is based upon mutual consent, the right of the employee or the employer to terminate the employment relationship at any time is recognized and affirmed.&nbsp; The policies in this handbook do not confer any vested rights on an employee or any right to continued employment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY</strong></h2>
<p>The Company will provide equal employment opportunities to its employees and applicants for employment and promotion on the basis of merit and qualification without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, or any other category protected by law.&nbsp; This policy shall be followed in recruiting, hiring, promotion, compensation, benefits, demotions, leave, and training programs.&nbsp; The Company will not tolerate any form of unlawful discrimination of its employees, including sexual or racial harassment.&nbsp;Complaints of discrimination will be thoroughly investigated and disciplinary or corrective action will be taken as warranted.&nbsp; Retaliation against employees who file complaints of discrimination is prohibited; however, such protection does not condone baseless or vindictive accusations of others.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>MEDIA CONTACTS</strong></h2>
<p>We request that media contacts, questions, and requests for interviews go through our CEO.&nbsp; In the event he is unavailable to respond in a timely manner, inquiries should be directed to another officer of the Company.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>
<p>Each employee has an obligation to keep all proprietary information of the Company confidential and not disclose it to any third party.&nbsp; The term "proprietary information" includes, but is not necessarily limited to, customer lists, technical, marketing, business, financial, or other information which constitutes trade secret information under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act or the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act.&nbsp;Employees must recognize that the Company’s proprietary information is a valuable, special, and unique asset of the Company’s business, and that the employee’s duty to keep such information confidential continues even after the termination of employment.</p>
<h2><strong>EMPLOYMENT CATEGORIES</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on your job, you are either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state wage and hour laws. If you are a NONEXEMPT employee, you are entitled to overtime pay under the specific provisions of federal and state laws. If you are an EXEMPT employee, you are excluded from the overtime pay provisions of federal and state wage and hour laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regular, Full-Time:&nbsp;</strong>Employees who are not in a temporary status and work a minimum of 30<strong>&nbsp;</strong>hours weekly and maintain continuous employment status. Generally, these employees are eligible for the full-time benefits package and are subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefits program.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;<strong>Regular, Part-Time:&nbsp;</strong>Employees who are not in a temporary status and who are regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours weekly, but at least 26 hours<strong>&nbsp;</strong>weekly, and who maintain continuous employment status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Temporary, Full-Time:&nbsp;</strong>Individuals who are engaged as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the workforce or to assist in the completion of a specific project and who are temporarily scheduled to work the Company’s full-time schedule for a limited duration. Engagement beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Temporary, Part-Time:&nbsp;</strong>Individuals who are engaged as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the workforce or to assist in the completion of a specific project and who are temporarily scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours weekly for a limited duration. Engagement beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in status.</p>
<h2><strong>PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each employee will generally be reviewed for job performance on an annual basis. These reviews include a written performance appraisal and discussion between the employee and the supervisor about job performance and expectations for the coming year.&nbsp;The performance appraisals are to be used in a constructive manner to help employees and supervisors have better communication as to the expected performance and/or to commend employees for jobs well done. Employees must keep in mind that an annual review does not automatically ensure an increase in compensation. Increases in compensation will be based on the employee’s performance and the overall performance of the Company.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>COMPLAINTS AND RETALIATION</strong></h2>
<p>The Company will not permit any form of retaliation against any person, who, in good faith, reports violations or suspected violations of law or Company policy.&nbsp; If employees observe possible unethical or illegal conduct, they are encouraged to report their concerns.&nbsp; Employees are urged to come forward with any such information, without regard to the identity or position of the suspected offender.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employees and others may communicate suspected violations of law, policy, or other wrongdoing, as well as any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters (including deficiencies in internal controls) by contacting their supervisor, the president, or another Company officer.&nbsp;The Company will treat all communications under this policy in a confidential manner, except to the extent necessary to conduct a complete and fair investigation, or for review of Company operations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company will not retaliate against any individual who in good faith reports a possible violation of law or Company policy, or reports any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, even if the report is mistaken, or who assists in the investigation of a reported violation.&nbsp; Any act of retaliation should be reported immediately.&nbsp; False complaints or those made in bad faith, however, will result in disciplinary action.</p>
<h2><strong>BULLETIN BOARDS</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Company bulletin boards are for the posting of government or Company postings only. All required governmental postings are posted on boards located in common areas. These boards may also contain general Company announcements; however, private messages are prohibited on any Company bulletin board.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SOLICITATION</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Employees should be able to work in an environment that is free from unnecessary annoyances and interference with their work. In order to protect our employees and visitors, solicitation by employees is strictly prohibited while either the employee being solicited or the employee doing the soliciting is on “working time.” “Working time” is defined as time during which an employee is not at a meal, on break, or on the premises immediately before or after his or her shift.&nbsp;Employees are also prohibited from distributing written materials, handbills, or any other type of literature on working time and, at all times, in “working areas,” which includes all office areas. “Working areas” do not include break rooms, parking lots, or common areas shared by employees during nonworking time.&nbsp;Non employees may not trespass or solicit or distribute materials anywhere on Company property at any time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CHANGES IN PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>
<p>It is&nbsp;the responsibility of the employee to notify the Human Resource Department should there be a change in address, phone, name or marital status.&nbsp; Failure to notify the Human Resource Department could affect some of your legal rights.&nbsp; Notification of any change must be in writing. For your convenience, notification by e-mail is&nbsp;sufficient.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION</strong></h2>
<p>The Company will provide a reasonable accommodation for any employee with a disability who needs that accommodation.&nbsp; If you feel you need an accommodation, please contact the HR Director to discuss it.</p>
<h1><strong>BENEFITS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>TIME OFF POLICIES</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">See the Team Guide in the Appendix for details of our time off policies.&nbsp; <strong>Please note</strong> that unused vacation time will be forfeited and will not be paid upon termination of employment.</p>
<h2><strong>FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE</strong></h2>
<p>In accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act, Family Medical Leave (FML) is available to eligible employees who need time off from work for their own serious health condition, the serious health condition of a family member, or the birth, adoption, or placement of a child in their home, and intend to return to work at the end of the leave. The individual may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of leave (both paid and unpaid) during a 12-month period.&nbsp;Employees who have been employed with the Company for at least one year and have actually worked 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months are eligible for FML.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Family and Medical Leave Act provides up to 12 workweeks of job protected leave during a 12-month period to eligible employees for one or more of the following events:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The birth and first-year care of the employee’s newborn child; the adoption of a child by the employee or the foster care placement in the employee’s home during the first year;</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The care of a spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition; when an employee is unable to perform the job duties of his/her position due to a serious health condition;</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">For any “qualifying exigency” (as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor) arising out of the fact that the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent of the employee is on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation.&nbsp; The Act also provides 26 weeks of leave during a 12-month period for a spouse, son, daughter, parent, or nearest blood relative caring for a recovering service member.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FML Definitions&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Job protected leave:</strong> The employee is guaranteed the right to return to his/her former position or to an equivalent job following the leave period.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Serious health condition:</strong> A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee’s job, or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities. Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of continuing treatment.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>12-month period:</strong> The Company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave under this policy. Each time an employee takes leave, the Company will compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this policy in the last 12 months and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the employee is entitled to take at that time. For military caregiver leave, the Company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period measured forward. FMLA leave already taken for other FMLA circumstances will be deducted from the total of 26 weeks available for military caregiver leave.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Notification Requirements&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">When the need for leave under FMLA is foreseeable such as in the case of the expected birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or a family member, the employee must provide at least 30 days advance notice to his/her supervisor. Employees are encouraged to schedule treatment and services in such a way as to limit the amount of disruption their absences will cause in the workplace.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">In the event that it is not practicable to give such advance notice due to a lack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, or a medical emergency, the employee should give as much advance notice as is practicable, ordinarily within one or two business days of when he/she learns of the need for the leave.&nbsp; An employee's failure to give timely notice could delay his/her eligibility for FMLA leave.&nbsp; Notices requesting leave under FMLA should be in writing.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">If an employee requests FML, the Company will inform the employee whether he/she is eligible under FMLA.&nbsp; If the employee is eligible, the Company will provide information about the employee’s rights and responsibilities.&nbsp; If the employee is not eligible, the Company will provide a reason for the ineligibility.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Medical Certification Requirements&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">When the necessity for FML exists due to the employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a spouse, parent, son or daughter, the employee must provide, at his or her own expense, certification from the health care provider(s) of the condition and a statement of the need for leave is required. This statement must include all information required on the US Department of Labor’s Medical Certification Form. This form is available on the Department of Labor’s website or from the Human Resources Department. The employee must submit a complete and sufficient medical certification to the Company within 15 days from the date you receive the certification form from us.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The Company may require a second opinion by a health care provider of its choice, and at its expense. If the two opinions differ, a third opinion may be requested from a provider selected jointly by the employee and the Company. This third opinion, to be paid for by the Company, is final and binding. The Company may also require periodic reports from the employee as to the employee's status and intent to return to work.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Use of Paid Leave&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When using FML, employees must first use all appropriate paid leave prior to the use of leave without pay. All absences qualifying for FML, whether paid or not, including absences paid under Worker's Compensation, will automatically count towards the employee’s 12-week FML allowance if the employee is otherwise eligible and has not exhausted his or her FML allowance.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Intermittent or Reduced Leave&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While most family and medical leave occurrences will require leave to be taken in a single block of several weeks, the employee may request “intermittent” leave or “reduced leave schedule” to care for a seriously ill family member and/or for the employee's own serious health condition where the need for leave is foreseeable and based on planned medical treatment. In the case of the need for a reduced leave schedule or intermittent use of leave, a certifica­tion of medical necessity is required from the health care provider and an appropriate work schedule must be planned in advance with the supervisor.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of intermittent leave would be the requirement to take chemotherapy treatments over a prolonged period which may not require a continuous block of absence but rather intermittent periods of absence to attend to the schedule of treatments. A reduced work schedule might also be the most effective solution in situations where an employee has shared responsibility with another family member or a third party for the care of a family member with a serious health condition. Time away from the job on an intermittent or reduced scheduled basis is to be counted hour for hour towards the 12 workweeks allowed under the Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If an employee requests intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule, the Company may temporarily transfer the employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits, if such a position is available, the employee is qualified for the position, and it better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular job.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Spouses Both Working with the Company&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In cases where both spouses are the Company employees, they may take a combined total of 12 weeks of FML for birth, adoption, foster care placement, and/or parental illness. They may each take twelve weeks for their own illness or that of their spouse or child. Situations involving both spouses working with the Company should be coordinated through Human Resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Insurance Continuation Privileges&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Employees on unpaid leave which is designated as FML will continue to receive, if eligible, health, dental, and life insurance benefits up to the maximum 12 workweeks allowed. These benefits will continue on the same basis as an active employee during this 12-week period. Whether on paid or unpaid leave of absence, the employee must make arrangements to pay applicable health and dental insurance costs for themselves and dependents. Those on unpaid leave must also make arrangements to continue other deductions, such as optional life insurance premiums. Your failure to make the payments will result in the termination of the insurance coverage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Effect on Other Benefits&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While on FML (paid or unpaid), an employee will continue to receive credit for service for the purposes of leave accrual. FML will be treated as “continued service” for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in benefit plans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In all cases where an employee is using some form of approved paid leave such as annual, personal and/or sick leave, the employee will continue to accrue leave benefits.&nbsp; If at some point paid leave is exhausted and unpaid leave is taken, employee benefits other than health, dental, and life insurance are discontinued for the duration of the unpaid leave status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Military Family Leave Entitlements</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eligible employees with a spouse, son, daughter, or parent on active duty or call to active-duty status in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings. The employee must provide within 15 days information on an approved form to the Company to support military exigency leave, plus a copy of the military member’s active-duty orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a covered service member during a single 12-month period. A covered service member is&nbsp; (1) a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or (2) a veteran who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran, and who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness. The employee must provide within 15 days information on an approved form to the Company to support military caregiver leave.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>MILITARY LEAVE</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Military leaves of absence and the reemployment rights of returning service members shall be granted in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp; Official documentation must be provided from the branch of service.&nbsp; Requests for military leaves should be submitted at least 30 days in advance, unless, for circumstances beyond the employee’s control such notice is not possible.&nbsp;In such cases, the employee must give as much notice as possible under the circumstances.</p>
<h2><strong>JURY DUTY</strong></h2>
<p>The Company supports employees in their civic duty to serve on a jury.&nbsp;Employees must present any summons to jury duty to their supervisor as soon as possible after receiving the notice to allow advance planning for an employee’s absence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Non-exempt employees will be paid for up to 2 weeks of jury duty service at their regular rate of pay minus any compensation received from the court for the period of service.&nbsp;Exempt employees are subject to the same 2-week limitation except that they will also receive pay for any days they serve as a juror or witness in a work-week in which they actually perform work.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All employees may use any accrued time off if required to serve more than 2 weeks on a jury. If an employee is released from jury duty after 4 hours or less of service, he or she must report to work for the remainder of that workday.&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<h2><strong>WITNESS AND VICTIM LEAVE</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Employees who are summoned as fact witnesses in a civil or criminal court proceeding in which they are neither the defendant nor the plaintiff will be granted leave without pay if they do not desire to use paid time off.&nbsp;Such leave shall cover only that period of time required for the giving of their testimony.&nbsp; Immediate return to the workplace is required upon early dismissal from court.&nbsp; The employee shall provide his/her supervisor with evidence of the required testimony prior to the granting of this leave, and will give as much advance notice as possible to his/her supervisor.&nbsp; An employee who is summoned as a witness for testimony in connection with a matter related to Company business on a scheduled work day will be paid his/her regular compensation by the Company for the lost time.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An employee who is a victim of a crime may leave work to be present at all criminal proceedings relating to a crime against the employee, as long as the employee has provided his/her supervisor with a copy of the standardized form listing the specific rights afforded to crime victims given to the employee by a law-enforcement agency, and provided to his/her supervisor in advance a copy of the notice of each scheduled criminal proceeding that is provided to the employee as victim. However, the Company may limit the leave provided under this paragraph if the employee's leave creates an undue hardship to the Company's business.&nbsp;The leave provided under this paragraph is without pay.</p>
<h2><strong>TIME OFF FOR VOTING</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company recognizes that voting is a right and privilege of being a citizen of the United States and encourages employees to exercise their right to vote.&nbsp; In almost all cases, you will have sufficient time outside working hours to vote. If for any reason you think this won’t be the case, contact your supervisor to discuss scheduling accommodations.</p>
<h2><strong>OTHER BENEFITS</strong></h2>
<p>Certain insurance and other benefits might be available to some employees, depending on your employee status.&nbsp;Ask management for details.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>WORKERS’ COMPENSATION</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you were injured on the job or suspect that you have a job-related illness, you must report this information to your supervisor or office personnel IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp; If the nature of the injury or illness makes it impossible for you to report it within the 24-hour period, you must report it as soon as possible. Any accident not reported promptly will not be covered by Worker’s Compensation. All job-related accidents will be subject to a drug test<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>A claim form stating the nature and extent of injury or illness must be completed and submitted immediately following the injury or symptoms of the job-related illness. See the more detailed discussion in the Safety Rules section of this handbook.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH</strong></h2>
<p>Virginia law provides employees with the right to reasonable accommodation for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.&nbsp; For more information, see Va. Code section 2.2-3909 at <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3909/">https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/2.2-3909/</a></p>
<h1><strong>TIMEKEEPING AND PAYROLL</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>TIME RECORDING</strong></h2>
<p>The Company records work hours of hourly employees with daily time records.&nbsp;Employees must record the actual times they begin and end work for the day.&nbsp; No employee of the Company is expected or permitted to work without such time being properly recorded on the daily time record and paid for properly.&nbsp; Unless specifically authorized by an officer of the Company, recording someone else’s time is prohibited.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>OVERTIME</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Overtime for non-exempt employees might be required in special circumstances.&nbsp; Nonexempt employees are normally on a 40-hour work week which begins on Monday.&nbsp; The Company reserves the right to require non-exempt employees to work reasonable amounts of overtime when necessary.&nbsp; All overtime for non-exempt employees must be approved in advance by the employee’s supervisor.<i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;In cases when obtaining prior approval is not possible, the employee must notify the supervisor as soon as possible following working the overtime hours.&nbsp; Failure to obtain approval can result in disciplinary action.&nbsp; Comp time is not available.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>DEDUCTIONS FROM SALARIES OF EXEMPT EMPLOYEES</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the policy of the Company to fully comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act.&nbsp; In keeping with this commitment, the Company will pay exempt employees their full salary for any workweek in which they perform work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked, subject only to deductions that are permitted by law.&nbsp;Full day deductions from pay that are permitted by law include, for example, deductions for personal time off, sick days before or after eligibility for paid sick leave, or deductions for infractions of written workplace conduct rules.&nbsp; Full or partial day deductions may be made from the salaries of exempt employees for infractions of safety rules of major significance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is further the Company’s policy to promptly investigate and correct any improper payroll deductions or other payroll practices that do not comply with the Act.&nbsp; If an employee believes that an improper payroll practice has occurred, such as an improper deduction from an exempt salary, he or she may make a complaint to the Company’s CEO, who will see that the matter is appropriately reviewed. The employee will be reimbursed for the amount of any inappropriate deduction taken.</p>
<h1><strong>EMPLOYEE CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE</strong></h1>
<h2>ATTENDANCE</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We expect Company employees to be reliable and punctual. You should report for work on time and as scheduled. If you cannot come to work or you will be late for any reason, you must notify your supervisor as soon as possible. Voice mail and e-mail messages are not acceptable except in certain emergency circumstances. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will result in discipline up to and including termination. Failure to show up or call in for a scheduled shift without prior approval may result in termination. If an employee fails to report to work or call in to inform the supervisor of the absence for 2 consecutive days or more, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned employment.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company expects employees to comply with the Company’s standards of behavior and performance and to correct any noncompliance with these standards. Under normal circumstances, the Company endorses a policy of progressive discipline in which it attempts to provide employees with notice of deficiencies and an opportunity to improve.&nbsp; It does, however, retain the right to administer discipline in any manner it sees fit. This policy does not modify the status of employees as employees-at-will or in any way restrict the Company’s right to bypass the disciplinary procedures suggested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following steps are suggested in the discipline procedure. All steps should be documented in the employee’s personnel file.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Step 1: Informal Discussion:</strong>&nbsp;When a performance problem is first identified, the nature of the problem and the action necessary to correct it should be thoroughly discussed with the employee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Step 2: Counseling:</strong>&nbsp; If a private informal discussion with the employee has not resulted in corrective action, following a thorough investigation, the supervisor should meet with the employee and (a) review the problem, (b) permit the employee to present his or her views on the problem, (c) advise the employee that the problem must be corrected, (d) inform the employee that failure to correct the problem will result in further disciplinary action which may include discharge, and (e) issue a written warning to the employee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Step 3: Written Reprimand:</strong>&nbsp; If satisfactory performance and corrective action are not achieved under Steps 1 and 2, the supervisor and his or her superior should meet with the employee in private and proceed via (a) through (d) above, and issue a written reprimand notice to the employee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Step 4: Suspension:</strong> Supervisors have the authority to temporarily remove employees from the workplace, with or without pay, if approved in advance by the appropriate Department Manager. An exempt employee generally may not be suspended without pay for less than a full day, and the suspension must be related to written workplace conduct rules applicable to all employees, e.g., such as a written policy prohibiting sexual harassment or workplace violence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Step 5: Failure to improve:</strong> Failure to improve performance or behavior after the written warning or suspension can result in termination. The progressive disciplinary procedures described above also may be applied to an employee who is experiencing a series of unrelated problems involving job performance or behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In cases involving serious misconduct or breach of safety rules or any time the supervisor determines it is necessary, such as an incident involving a major breach of policy or violation of law, the procedures contained above may be disregarded, at the sole discretion of the Company.&nbsp; Typically, the supervisor should suspend the employee immediately (with or without pay, as appropriate, given the circumstances) and conduct an investigation of the incident leading up to the suspension to determine if any further action, such as termination, should be taken.</p>
<h2><strong>SERIOUS OFFENSES</strong></h2>
<p>The following are <strong>examples</strong> of violations of company policy that may lead to immediate dismissal and loss of all accrued benefits.&nbsp; The following violations also mean the employee will not be eligible for rehire by the company and will not qualify for unemployment compensation and benefits:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company is committed to providing a work environment that is free from all forms of discrimination and conduct that can be considered harassing, coercive, or disruptive, including sexual harassment. The Company will not tolerate any actions, words, jokes, or comments based on a person's sex, race, color, national origin, age, religion, disability, or any other legally protected characteristic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual advances, or visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. This definition includes many forms of offensive behavior and includes gender-based harassment of a person of the same sex as the harasser.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical), requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; (2) submission or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions; or, (3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you experience or witness sexual or other unlawful harassment at work, report it immediately to your supervisor. If your supervisor is unavailable or you believe it would be inappropriate to discuss it with your supervisor, you should immediately contact the Company’s CEO. There will not be punishment or reprisal if you report sexual harassment or ask questions or raise concerns about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All allegations of sexual harassment will be quickly and discreetly investigated. To the extent possible, your confidentiality and the confidentiality of any witnesses and the alleged harasser will be protected against unnecessary disclosure. When the investigation is completed, you will be informed of the outcome of the investigation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any supervisor or manager who becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment must immediately advise the CEO so it can be investigated in a timely and confidential manner. Any employee who engages in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<h2><strong>DRESS AND GROOMING</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company provides a casual yet professional work environment for its employees. Even though the dress code is casual, it is important to project a professional image to our customers, visitors, and coworkers. Except as otherwise set forth in the Company’s Safety Rules and Team Guide, all employees are expected to dress in a manner consistent with good hygiene (to include the wearing of clean clothes), safety, and good taste. Employees are to use common sense and present a professional work appearance.&nbsp; Any questions or complaints regarding the appropriateness of attire should be directed to your supervisor.</p>
<h2><strong>DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE POLICY</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an effort to help ensure a safe working environment, the Company has adopted a drug and alcohol abuse policy.&nbsp; This policy applies to full, part-time and temporary employees.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The use, possession, distribution, or sale of any detectable amount of alcohol or illegal drugs on Company premises or during break or lunch periods in the course of the workday is prohibited and considered a willful violation of Company Policy which can result in employment suspension and discharge.&nbsp; (“Company premises” for this policy includes the main office, shop, all job sites, Company vehicles, and any other site where the Company is conducting business in any manner.)&nbsp; Gifts to Company management from customers are an exception to this rule.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">All employees have the responsibility to report to and be at work in a condition to perform their jobs so as not to create unnecessary risk to themselves or other persons or property.&nbsp; Employees are prohibited from reporting to work under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.&nbsp; This policy is motivated by the company’s concern for the safety of employees and other individuals.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">All employees will be subject to drug and alcohol screening as follows:</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If the employee is involved in an accident</strong>&nbsp;which involves property damage or personal injury requiring medical treatment other than on-site first aid during hours of employment.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">If the supervisor/foreman has <strong>reasonable suspicion</strong> of alcohol or drug use.&nbsp;The employee will be promptly notified of the circumstances that formed the basis of the reasonable suspicion.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As part of Company-required random screening</strong>.&nbsp; The Company reserves the option to test a portion of the total number of employees each year.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sanctions and Disciplinary Actions</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A first offense will result in disciplinary action which could include termination of employment, depending upon the nature of the offense and the employee’s record.&nbsp; Refusal to cooperate with or submit to drug and alcohol screening or treatment as required by the Company will subject the employee to immediate discharge.</p>
<h2>USE OF COMPANY VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Company vehicles and equipment must be used with care.&nbsp;Only authorized company employees may use Company vehicles and equipment, and they may be used for Company purposes only.&nbsp; Personal use of a Company vehicle is only permitted if authorized by an officer of the Company.&nbsp; Employees operating Company vehicles on public highways must have a valid operator's license in their possession at all times.&nbsp; Employees operating off-highway equipment must be experienced with all aspects of the equipment, must have documented training to include certifications as required by OSHA, and must operate the equipment safely at all times. &nbsp;Follow all warning signs on equipment, do not put gas in diesel tanks, and if it appears the equipment is not operating properly, let the foreman know. Do not operate equipment if you know there is something wrong with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No drinking of alcoholic beverages in company vehicles is permitted.&nbsp;No open containers of alcoholic beverages in company vehicles are permitted.&nbsp; <strong>Violation of this policy will be cause for immediate termination.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>SEARCHES OF PROPERTY</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the course of performing work for the Company, employees are given access to Company property, including vehicles, equipment, and technology.&nbsp; The Company retains the right to search these items with or without notice.&nbsp;Additionally, the Company retains the right to search and access all information and property related to the employee’s work or located in the employee’s workspace.&nbsp; This includes, but is not limited to, electronic and hard copy files, e-mails, desks, lockers, computers, backpacks, briefcases, purses, and vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>PHONE USAGE</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Company land line telephones:&nbsp;</strong>They are for business use and should not be used for personal calls. Please use the telephone for personal calls only during breaks or during your lunch period. Calls should be for business reasons and limited in their length. Incoming personal callers will be asked to leave a message or a number to call back which will be given to your supervisor. In the event of an emergency call, you will be notified immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company reserves the right to monitor customer calls to ensure employees abide by Company quality guidelines and provide appropriate levels of customer service. Employees working in sales and customer service will be subject to telephone monitoring and e-mail. Should the subject matter of any telephone conversation become personal while monitoring is taking place, monitoring of the call will immediately be discontinued.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cell phones:&nbsp;</strong>The Company endeavors to create a safe environment for all its employees and customers while balancing the need to maintain reasonable communications. To effectively balance these concerns, the Company requires the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">While working, cell phones and all other electronic devices (headphones, iPads, etc.) are prohibited from use for safety reasons unless necessary to conduct business or for handling emergencies and, then, limited to handling that business need or emergency (this prohibition does not apply to breaks while in a break/lunch room or outside the Client’s building[s]).</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Because the Company is committed to promoting highway safety and minimizing risk to the well-being of our employees and independent contractors, cell phone usage or the use of other electronic devices while driving&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong>conducting business on behalf of the Company will be reduced to only that of necessity.&nbsp;Drivers are prohibited from using the following types of devices while driving: hand-held cell phones, other hand-held electronic devices, and electronic devices that require the use of hands.&nbsp; Hands-free cell phones and other hands-free devices are permitted, provided that their use does not distract the driver.&nbsp; If drivers use hands-free devices, they are expected to keep calls short, refrain from discussion of complicated or emotional issues, pay attention to traffic, and keep their eyes on the road.&nbsp; Texting or e-mailing while driving is absolutely prohibited.&nbsp; Safety must come before all other concerns.&nbsp; If it is necessary to use a hand-held cell phone, drivers must pull off to the side of the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting a call.&nbsp;Drivers who are charged with traffic violations resulting from the use of a cell phone or other electronic device while driving will be solely responsible for all liabilities that result from such actions.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The Company provides certain of its employees with cell phones for use while conducting company business. In the event that a phone is lost, stolen, or destroyed, the employee may be responsible for replacement.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>RETURN OF PROPERTY</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company may loan you property, materials, or written information to help you do your job. You are responsible for protecting, preserving, and controlling any property we loan you. &nbsp;You must also return it promptly if we ask. If you stop working at the Company, you must return all Company property immediately in the same condition as when it was issued to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By accepting employment with the Company, you are agreeing that, if you do not return our property in the same condition as when it was issued to you, we may take money from your regular or final paycheck to cover the cost to the fullest extent permitted by law. &nbsp;We may also take legal action to get back our property.</p>
<h2><strong>DAMAGE TO PROPERTY</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company may provide you with hotel or other housing accommodations while you are working at a worksite far from your home.&nbsp; The Company expects its employees to respect the property of others, and will insist that an employee who willfully damages a hotel or other property of another pay compensation for the damage.&nbsp; Such property damage is a violation of the Company’s conduct rules and will result in disciplinary action which could include termination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By accepting employment with the Company, you are agreeing that, if you intentionally or recklessly damage the property of another while on a job assignment with the Company, we may take money from your regular or final paychecks to cover the cost of the damage to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2><strong>WORKPLACE VIOLENCE</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work environment. Given the increasing violence in society in general, the Company has adopted the following policy to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual) violence that may occur during business hours or on its premises. Employees who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, arrest, and prosecution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All employees, including supervisors and temporary employees, sub-contractors, and clients of the Company should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, "horseplay," or other conduct that may be dangerous to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, client, customer, vendor, sub-contractor, or any member of the public related to the business at any time, including conduct during off-duty hours, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, or any characteristic protected by law. All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible to your immediate supervisor or any officer of the Company. This includes threats by employees as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, sub-contractors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible. Any person engaging in threats of (or actual) violence may be removed from the Company’s premises or job site and property as quickly as safety permits. Individuals who have been removed from the Company property or job site shall remain off the premises or job site, as the case may be, pending the outcome of the Company and/or criminal investigations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to a supervisor. No employee will be subjected to retaliation for reporting, in good faith, any threat or perceived threat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) violence and of suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, the Company may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation.&nbsp;The Company may also, at its option, discipline or terminate the offending employee, terminate or suspend business relationships with, reassign job duties, or initiate criminal prosecution of the person or persons involved. No Company policy, practice, or procedure should be interpreted to prohibit decisions designed to prevent a threat from being carried out, a violent act from occurring, or a life-threatening situation from developing.</p>
