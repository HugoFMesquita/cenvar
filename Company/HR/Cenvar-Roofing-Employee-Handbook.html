<h1><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This employee handbook has been prepared to help you become familiar with some of the policies of Good’s Construction Co., LLC, doing business as Cenvar Roofing (“the Company”) concerning your employment.&nbsp;The handbook is not intended to be a complete statement of all Company policies.&nbsp; From time to time, circumstances might require management to modify or revise these policies, and policies may be communicated to you orally or through other written notices.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The handbook is not an express or implied employment contract. Your employment is “at will.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Because employment with the Company is based upon mutual consent, the right of the employee or the employer to terminate the employment relationship at any time is recognized and affirmed.&nbsp; The policies in this handbook do not confer any vested rights on an employee or any right to continued employment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY</strong></h2>
<p>The Company will provide equal employment opportunities to its employees and applicants for employment and promotion on the basis of merit and qualification without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, or any other category protected by law.&nbsp; This policy shall be followed in recruiting, hiring, promotion, compensation, benefits, demotions, leave, and training programs.&nbsp; The Company will not tolerate any form of unlawful discrimination of its employees, including sexual or racial harassment.&nbsp;Complaints of discrimination will be thoroughly investigated and disciplinary or corrective action will be taken as warranted.&nbsp; Retaliation against employees who file complaints of discrimination is prohibited; however, such protection does not condone baseless or vindictive accusations of others.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>MEDIA CONTACTS</strong></h2>
<p>We request that media contacts, questions, and requests for interviews go through our CEO.&nbsp; In the event he is unavailable to respond in a timely manner, inquiries should be directed to another officer of the Company.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>
<p>Each employee has an obligation to keep all proprietary information of the Company confidential and not disclose it to any third party.&nbsp; The term "proprietary information" includes, but is not necessarily limited to, customer lists, technical, marketing, business, financial, or other information which constitutes trade secret information under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act or the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act.&nbsp;Employees must recognize that the Company’s proprietary information is a valuable, special, and unique asset of the Company’s business, and that the employee’s duty to keep such information confidential continues even after the termination of employment.</p>
<h2><strong>EMPLOYMENT CATEGORIES</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on your job, you are either NONEXEMPT or EXEMPT from federal and state wage and hour laws. If you are a NONEXEMPT employee, you are entitled to overtime pay under the specific provisions of federal and state laws. If you are an EXEMPT employee, you are excluded from the overtime pay provisions of federal and state wage and hour laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regular, Full-Time:&nbsp;</strong>Employees who are not in a temporary status and work a minimum of 30<strong>&nbsp;</strong>hours weekly and maintain continuous employment status. Generally, these employees are eligible for the full-time benefits package and are subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefits program.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;<strong>Regular, Part-Time:&nbsp;</strong>Employees who are not in a temporary status and who are regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours weekly, but at least 26 hours<strong>&nbsp;</strong>weekly, and who maintain continuous employment status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Temporary, Full-Time:&nbsp;</strong>Individuals who are engaged as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the workforce or to assist in the completion of a specific project and who are temporarily scheduled to work the Company’s full-time schedule for a limited duration. Engagement beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in status.</p>

<h2><strong>PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each employee will generally be reviewed for job performance on an annual basis. These reviews include a written performance appraisal and discussion between the employee and the supervisor about job performance and expectations for the coming year.&nbsp;The performance appraisals are to be used in a constructive manner to help employees and supervisors have better communication as to the expected performance and/or to commend employees for jobs well done. Employees must keep in mind that an annual review does not automatically ensure an increase in compensation. Increases in compensation will be based on the employee’s performance and the overall performance of the Company.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>COMPLAINTS AND RETALIATION</strong></h2>
<p>The Company will not permit any form of retaliation against any person, who, in good faith, reports violations or suspected violations of law or Company policy.&nbsp; If employees observe possible unethical or illegal conduct, they are encouraged to report their concerns.&nbsp; Employees are urged to come forward with any such information, without regard to the identity or position of the suspected offender.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employees and others may communicate suspected violations of law, policy, or other wrongdoing, as well as any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters (including deficiencies in internal controls) by contacting their supervisor, the president, or another Company officer.&nbsp;The Company will treat all communications under this policy in a confidential manner, except to the extent necessary to conduct a complete and fair investigation, or for review of Company operations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Company will not retaliate against any individual who in good faith reports a possible violation of law or Company policy, or reports any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, even if the report is mistaken, or who assists in the investigation of a reported violation.&nbsp; Any act of retaliation should be reported immediately.&nbsp; False complaints or those made in bad faith, however, will result in disciplinary action.</p>
<h2><strong>BULLETIN BOARDS</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Company bulletin boards are for the posting of government or Company postings only. All required governmental postings are posted on boards located in common areas. These boards may also contain general Company announcements; however, private messages are prohibited on any Company bulletin board.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SOLICITATION</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Employees should be able to work in an environment that is free from unnecessary annoyances and interference with their work. In order to protect our employees and visitors, solicitation by employees is strictly prohibited while either the employee being solicited or the employee doing the soliciting is on “working time.” “Working time” is defined as time during which an employee is not at a meal, on break, or on the premises immediately before or after his or her shift.&nbsp;Employees are also prohibited from distributing written materials, handbills, or any other type of literature on working time and, at all times, in “working areas,” which includes all office areas. “Working areas” do not include break rooms, parking lots, or common areas shared by employees during nonworking time.&nbsp;Non employees may not trespass or solicit or distribute materials anywhere on Company property at any time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CHANGES IN PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>
<p>It is&nbsp;the responsibility of the employee to notify the Human Resource Department should there be a change in address, phone, name or marital status.&nbsp; Failure to notify the Human Resource Department could affect some of your legal rights.&nbsp; Notification of any change must be in writing. For your convenience, notification by e-mail is&nbsp;sufficient.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION</strong></h2>
<p>The Company will provide a reasonable accommodation for any employee with a disability who needs that accommodation.&nbsp; If you feel you need an accommodation, please contact the HR Director to discuss it.</p>
