<h1><strong>Photo Tips for Marketing Images</strong></h1>
<p>Images are powerful tools - they are memorable, communicate faster than words, keep readers engaged, and help drive sales. This wiki provides helpful tips when taking photos to maximize their effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples provided are directed toward Cenvar Solar, but the same principles apply to the entire Cenvar brand of companies including Varcen.</p>
<h2><strong>Corporate Office</strong></h2>
<p>1. <strong>Entrance and Logo</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capture the entrance with the Cenvar's name and logo prominently displayed. This will help with brand recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Employee Interaction</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Show employees in their work environment, highlighting teamwork, discussions, or any activity that embodies culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Eco-Friendly Features</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the office has sustainable or green features, be sure to photograph them. This reinforces commitment to sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Job Sites&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Employees at Work</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capture employees installing solar panels or equipment. It showcases expertise and commitment. <u>ALWAYS</u> make sure to capture Cenvar's brand. Example: Cenvar worker with Cenvar apparel working on a roof, finished photo with a yard sign/Cenvar vehicle parked in the street with an overall shot of the home or just the logo in the top corner.</p>
<p><i><strong>Here is an example of a good photo:&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:470px;"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CT1LRaxM9lCv_hRQ3JAIo90YfZ1BbIa4Park0wYoF-JTkmnEV3pIuhRhy-4ciNQVEajJMEgrttBV6MUlbQUxuBqNzedr8qrz9E7esBAkZesk3wWIdDwF22bOy9j8pOhrsTWHC9_0-rIylNGMUJQ1B8s"></figure>
<p><i><strong>And here is an ok one; Cenvar worker is wearing brand apparel, but it is not prominent in the shot:</strong></i></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:471px;"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xSMDZKT8U_G3D76V1Y2c-N4j8EMmC4u2pZ68HEEXm5x3xM_xtMETcFdvalhcbIQawM49r1dLtcccD1MwGcRX8dVSGN10m7qqLS4hlH89_GYPnyPtdQP91RVaoeX3yzm3nH80e_MG16pMnu_LUh71zh4"></figure>
<p><br>&nbsp;<strong>2. Equipment</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed shots of solar panels, inverters, or other machinery that is essential to the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Drones</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>If possible, aerial shots can provide a unique perspective of larger installations.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Recent Projects&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Homeowner</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>If homeowners are willing, capture them with the new solar installations, capture Cenvar's name and logo in the shot. This can be a powerful marketing tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Golden Hour</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take photos during the golden hour (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) to make the solar installation stand out with the warm light. <u>Again, capture Cenvar's name and logo in the shot!</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Technical Details</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close-ups of junction boxes, mounts, or unique installation methods that set Cenvar apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>I<strong>ntegration with Home Design</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Show how solar panels not only serve a functional purpose but also blend seamlessly with a home's aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>General Tips&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Consistent Branding</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>ALWAYS</u> </strong>attempt to<strong> </strong>incorporate Cenvar's branding elements into the pictures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Storytelling</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Craft a narrative with photos, or video. This could be the journey of a solar installation project from start to finish or the day in the life of a technician. This would be great for a<u> blog article, or a YouTube video!</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Editing</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhance clarity, brightness, and sharpness of photos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim is to not only showcase Cenvar's brand, but also our values, dedication to sustainability, and commitment to the community.</p>
