<h2><strong>How To Receive an E-Check in Quickbooks</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Go into Job Progress to the “Finance” section of the account you are trying to receive the check on.</li>
  <li>Go to the “Payments Received” field and press the “+” button.</li>
  <li>Enter the check information and save the payment.</li>
  <li>Go into QuickBooks to hit drop-down for customers and click into the “Customer Center”.</li>
  <li>Search for the customer by name. (Note: Payments may take a few minutes to come over from Job Progress)</li>
  <li>Double click the payment that you put into Job Progress.</li>
  <li>Click “E-Check” once the payment screen opens.</li>
  <li>A new window will open and will ask for the routing number &amp; the account number, both of which are available at the bottom of the check. Once you have everything filled in, press “Process Payment”.</li>
  <li>Keep the checks received as E-Checks in an office file so that if we need to revisit one, we still have them.</li>
</ol>
