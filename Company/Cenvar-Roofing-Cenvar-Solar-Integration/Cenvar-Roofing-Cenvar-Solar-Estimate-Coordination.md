1.  When either division receives a lead for the other division and the customer is interested in both services, the lead shall be sent over to the appointment setter of the other division, via email, along with a note advising that the customer is getting estimates for both roofing and solar.
2.  The sales appointment setter shall put a note in the appointment alerting the salesman to the fact that the customer is going to be meeting with both solar and roofing sales representatives.
3.  Roofing sales representatives, when submitting an estimate to a customer who is getting quotes for both roofing and solar, shall send the quote to both the customer and to [_contact@cenvarsolar.com_](mailto:contact@cenvarsolar.com). Solar shall attach the roofing quote to the solar customer in their CRM.
4.  Each sales representative shall follow up as normal with customers who have received quotes from both divisions. As soon as either sales representative receives a buying commitment from the customer, he shall inform his counterpart via email or text.
5.  When a customer decides to proceed with both roofing and solar, the roofing sales representative shall void the original contract and send a new one that has the price at zero, he shall then add the JP snippet that addresses solar.  The financials in JP shall remain populated with the price.
6.  For customers who end up signing with both roofing and solar, solar shall take the lead and shall be the division that takes primary responsibility for communicating with the customer.
7.  In most instances, the roofing division will be ready to install the roof well before solar is ready to install solar. The roofing branch office manager will contact the solar project manager and inform him that the roof is ready to be scheduled, and then receiving clearance, will deal directly with the customer to schedule the roof for installation.
8.  In instances where solar is ready for the roof before the roofing branch office manager contacts them, solar shall reach out at least one week prior to when they need the roof installed and the roofing branch office manager will schedule the roof installation directly with the customer.  Solar shall get priority for scheduling in comparison to regular jobs in this situation.  The roofing branch office manager shall keep the solar project manager informed of all scheduling changes just as he/she does the customer.  He/she shall also inform the solar project manager as soon as roofing is complete.
9.  When the roofing project is complete, the roofing branch office manager shall send the solar project manager an updated invoice that includes upcharges such as wood replacement etc. These charges shall be added to the final invoice from solar before sending the final invoice to the customer.
10.  Solar will be responsible for invoicing the customer for both services and then will pass the roofing portion along to the roofing division.
