  <li><strong>February 2022 Lead Contest:</strong> From the desk of Chris Good - <i>"In an effort to find ways to generate growth, we decided to run a promotion for the whole company. We are going to pay $100 per roof replacement appointment generated by our staff for the month of February, or until we have spent 10K dollars. So, as you are out and about doing your job and notice someone who could use a new roof, knock on their door and ask if they would like a free estimate. Out and about on your free time, randomly ask people if they or anyone they know, needs a new roof anytime soon. When I was a Realtor, I asked every single person I talked to if they happened to know anyone getting ready to buy or sell a house. I found houses to sell at the grocery store, at the gas station... all over the place."</i></li>

However, we received the following highlighted nomination from one of his colleagues that really speaks volumes about Austin’s work ethic and character. Way to go, Austin! HIGHLIGHTED NOMINATION: “Austin has worked here dating back to the old Lynchburg Roofing days, starting along with his friend Joey. They had no experience but they brought a desire to learn roofing and a strong work ethic. Austin showed his grit as he stuck it out on the crew, through the summer heat and the winter freezes and graduated from laborer to a roof mechanic. As the branch grew, he got the opportunity to work with Brian Laverty in the repair and gutter department where his knowledge and skills have continued his growth. He has also grown as a man, becoming both a husband and a father since he started with us. He demonstrates his self discipline by coming in faithfully and on-time every day readying himself for the day's jobs so he can support his family. It seems like just yesterday when he started and I'm so proud of what he has made of himself, he deserves employee of the month.” Swell comments from our customers: “He was prompt, courteous, and efficient.” “Very professional and we were extremely pleased with the job.” “Hunter and Austin arrived on time and prepared to work.
