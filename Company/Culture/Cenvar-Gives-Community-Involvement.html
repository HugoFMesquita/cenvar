<h2><strong>Community Engagement – (Cenvar Gives) Policy -</strong></h2>
<p>Did you know that a percentage of each of our branch’s annual profit is allocated to fund local charitable initiatives. We believe it is important to be actively involved in the communities we live in.</p>
<p>All branch team members are encouraged to suggest community outreach Cenvar Gives roofing project ideas all year long to their General Manager for vetting and approval.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, if you have a Cenvar Gives roofing project idea, or if you have something charitable that is on your heart for the branch to contribute to, be sure to submit the ideas to your General Manager all year long for approval!</p>
