<p>The Cenvar Roofing Roof Inspection Form is to be used for roof inspections. Please refer to the <a href="/i/170">Job Progress Service Proposal â€“ Temporary Tarps or Roof Inspections Process</a> Wiki for additional information.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note: Roof inspections will be performed free-of-charge to homeowners of single-family homes, solar companies, &amp; any company that owns the structure they wish to inspect and will include an oral report. All other roof inspections will be performed for $250 and will be accompanied with a written inspection report (realtors, apartment complexes, multi-family buildings, commercial, etc.. are the most common applications for this paid service). A homeowner of a single-family home can still request a written report, but they will be charged $250.</li>
