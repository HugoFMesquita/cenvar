<p><strong>The Sales Representative is responsible to add the customer information to the Soft Schedule Job Board</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer Name</li>
  <li>Color of the Shingle (if selected at the time of signing)<ul>
      <li>* Any time that the customer selects the shingle color, the Sales Rep is required to update the board with the color.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Number of Square</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Office Manager (OM) is responsible to schedule all jobs, and accurately document the correct information on the branch Job Board.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Office Manager is responsible to maintain the schedule, and to communicate any and all scheduling changes with the customer.</li>
  <li>OM is responsible to call the customer if there are any schedule changes due to:<ul>
      <li>crew is running ahead of schedule.</li>
      <li>crew is running behind schedule.</li>
      <li>weather delay.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>OM is responsible to move / rearrange the affected customer on the job board to accurately reflect the revised crew schedule.</li>
  <li>OM erases &amp; rewrites the calendar on the job board when needed for a new week.</li>
  <li>*Because the future cannot be accurately predicted, the Job Scheduled Board changes frequently.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Color Selection:</strong></h2>
<p>The Customer Color Selection Policy must be followed for each job.</p>

<h2>Soft Schedule Job Board</h2>
<p>The <strong>Soft Schedule Job Board</strong> is the list of customers who have signed the sales contract but are not yet scheduled. The <strong>Soft Schedule</strong> is a list of all future jobs to be scheduled.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sales Rep writes: the customer information on the <strong>Soft Schedule Job Board</strong>.</li>
  <li>Sales Rep includes: customer last name</li>
  <li>Sales Rep includes: number of days estimated in job in parenthesis</li>
  <li>Sales Rep includes: Sales Rep Initials</li>
  <li>Sales Rep includes: any specific notes (example: metal, + gutters, etc)</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE: <strong>Camm (1.5) RT </strong>– Camm = customer last name, (1.5) = number of days estimated in the job, RT = initials of sales rep Ryan Thivierge</li>
</ul>

<p><i><strong>Soft Schedule Job Board Example #2</strong></i></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Soft Schedule Job Board is divided into 2 separate lists:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Soft Schedule: No Colors</strong> – this is a list of customers who have signed the contract, but have not selected their shingle color yet.<ol>
      <li>The OM cannot provide a start date until the customer has selected a shingle color. (see above)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Soft Schedule: With Color Selected</strong> – this is a list of customers who have signed the contract, have a shingle color selected, but have not been placed on the Hard Schedule Job Board yet.<ul>
      <li>Once the customer selects the shingle color, the OM moves the customer to the Soft Schedule: With Color Selected list, and they are placed at the bottom of this list.</li>
      <li>The OM will work to move customers ‘up’ the list by moving them in order of ‘first come, first serve’.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong>: <strong>A customer cannot be placed on the Hard Schedule without a color selection.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Customers must understand that they are not in our scheduling queue until they have chosen a color.</li>
  <li>The customer goes to the back of the line at the time of color selection, not at the time of contract signing.</li>
  <li>OM: send the updated Material List with updated color selection to: <a href="mailto:delivery@cenvarroofing.com"><u>delivery@cenvarroofing.com</u></a></li>
  <li>OM: add a ‘checkmark’ next to the customer name on the board.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hard Schedule Job Board</h2>
<p><strong>The Hard Schedule Job Board is an accurate 4 week schedule of crew roofing jobs. The Hard Schedule is generally a snapshot of 1. last week, 2. the current week, 3. next week, &amp; 4. two weeks out.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Office manager (OM) contacts the customer via telephone to update them with the scheduled job start date.</li>
  <li>OM writes the customer information on the <strong>Hard Schedule Job Board</strong> to the <i>right </i>of the available day / date. <i>(see below details)</i></li>
  <li>OM locates the customer name on the <strong>Soft Schedule Job Board</strong>, and erases the customer name &amp; information.</li>
  <li>OM includes: customer last name</li>
  <li>OM includes: Sales Rep Initials</li>
  <li>OM includes: number of days estimated in job</li>
  <li>OM includes: a colored dot to indicate that the material list has been sent to <a href="mailto:delivery@cenvarroofing.com"><u>delivery@cenvarroofing.com</u></a> . The colored dot is helpful when there are a lot of crews being scheduled at the same time.</li>
  <li>OM includes: Bring From Shop or Delivery to specify where the materials are being sourced from.</li>
  <li>EXAMPLE: Camm (1) RT – Camm = customer last name, (1) = number of days estimated in the job, RT = initials of sales rep Ryan Thivierge</li>
