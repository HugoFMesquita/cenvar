<ul>
  <li>Sales Conversion Rate: Goal: 60% / Minimum: 45%</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sales Representative KPIs will be evaluated based on a one-year rolling average. If performance falls below the minimum goal, the Sales Representative will be placed on a 90-day probationary period. Failure to meet the minimum goal by the end of probation will result in termination. Additionally, a Sales Representative may not be placed on probation more than twice within a calendar year.</p>
