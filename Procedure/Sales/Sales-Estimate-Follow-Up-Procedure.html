<p>Once a customer sales presentation has been completed and the quote has been sent to the customer, the job is moved to the<strong> Estimated: Sales F/U Required</strong> stage in Job Progress.</p>
<h2><strong>Proposal on Hold:&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>This stage is to be used if the Sales Representative is waiting for an Eagle View, material pricing, etc.</p>
<p>Once the estimate is sent to the customer, the job must be moved to the <strong>Estimated: Sales F/U Required</strong> stage.</p>
<p>When a job is added to this stage, both a follow up note and follow up calendar event must be created. <a href="/i/250"><strong>The exact follow up procedure must be followed every time, for every job</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Estimated: Sales F/U Required</strong>: The sales representative has 7 calendar days to follow up with the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The job remains in this stage for a maximum of 7 calendar days from the date of quote.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is the stage for fresh / new leads.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Sales Representative to make multiple follow up attempts within the 7 calendar days, and document each telephone call / attempt with a separate Follow-up Call&nbsp;Note.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a job is added to this stage, both a follow up note and follow up calendar event must be created. <a href="/i/250"><strong>The exact follow up procedure must be followed every time, for every job</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>If the customer signs the contract, the job is moved to the <strong>Signed Contract</strong> stage.</p>
<p>If the customer has not decided to sign the contract but there is a possibility that they will sign the contract, the job is moved to the <strong>Estimated: Additional Follow Up Required</strong> stage for future follow up calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the customer is not ready to sign the contract yet, but is indicating they would like to be contacted at a future date more than 30 days out, the job is to be moved to the <strong>Possible Future Work (Quoted)</strong> stage.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Estimated: Additional Follow Up Required:</strong></h2>
<p>This stage is the responsibility of the sales representative to follow up regularly with the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sales promotions will be sent to all customers in this stage.</li>
  <li>Any job in this stage is required to have both a <strong>‘Follow Up Call Note”</strong> (not Job Note) and a <strong>"Follow Up Reminder calendar event."</strong>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>When a job is added to this stage, both a follow up note and follow up calendar event must be created. <a href="/i/250"><strong>The exact follow up procedure must be followed every time, for every job.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>If a Sales Representative is unable to successfully connect with a customer, they are required to make customer sales follow-up phone calls twice a week for the first 4 weeks, followed by once a week for an additional 2 weeks, before archiving the account.</p>
<p>The sales representative must create a follow-up call note in Job Progress detailing each telephone and email attempt.</p>
<p>After 6 weeks, if the customer still has not signed, the sales representative must archive the quote in Job Progress with a Job Note detailing why it was moved or archived, or move it into <strong>Possible Future Work (Quoted) if the customer has requested contact at a future date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Sales Representative to continue to follow up with the customer regularly, move it into the <strong>Possible Future Work (Quoted)</strong> stage if the customer asks to be contacted at a date further out than 30 days, or to archive it.</p>
<p>Branch General Managers will also closely monitor this stage.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<strong>Possible Future Work (Quoted):&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>There is no maximum number of days that a job can remain in this stage as long as there are current notes and a customer follow up calendar event.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Example: The customer has asked the sales representative to call back at a date 8 months later.</li>
  <li>All quotes where the customer has indicated that they would like specific action from the salesperson at a date more remote than 30 days are put into this stage.</li>
  <li>Every job in this stage must have a detailed ‘<i><strong>Follow-up Call Note</strong></i>” (not Job Note) explaining the future action the customer requested.</li>
  <li>Upon moving the quote into this stage, the Salesperson must create a <strong>"Follow Up Reminder calendar event</strong>" in Job Progress prompting the action the customer requested.</li>
  <li>Any job in this stage is required to have both a<strong> "Follow Up Call Note”</strong> (not Job Note) and a <strong>"Follow Up Reminder calendar event"</strong> within 30 calendar days from the sales appointment. <a href="/i/250"><strong>The exact follow up procedure must be followed every time, for every job.</strong></a></li>
  <li>Sales promotions will be sent to all customers in this stage.</li>
  <li>Sales Representatives can enter a maximum Follow Up date of 1 year.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the Sales Representatives responsibility to determine if a job is ‘dead’ (a job is considered dead if the job has no note calling for future action by the Sales Representative, and the corresponding reminder for action).&nbsp; Once the job is ‘dead’, the Sales Representative must Archive the job in Job Progress, and add a Job Note detailing why it was archived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any job that does not fit into the above job stages must be archived in Job Progress with the Job Flag “Job Lost”, and a Job Note detailing why it was archived. <strong>The Cenvar Roofing </strong><a href="/i/130"><strong>Inventory Management Sheet </strong></a><strong>is critical to ensure that all product &amp; materials are accounted for daily.</strong></p>
