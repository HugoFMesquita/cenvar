<p>Any time a customer indicates that there is a leak / water intrusion, the Sales Representative needs to investigate to try to find the root cause.</p>
<p>If the customer feels confident that they know where the leak is, the Sales Representative should trust them, but verify.</p>
<p>If the Sales Representative can positively determine the cause of the leak, they should communicate their findings to the customer and enter the snippet in Leap ‘Leak source determined, roof replacement proposal’ on both the contract and the work order.</p>
<p>If it cannot be determined that the source is from the roof, the Sales Representative needs inform the customer that they were unable to positively determine the cause and that replacing the roof will not guarantee that the leak will stop.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The customer may wish to proceed with a roof replacement; in this case, enter the snippet ‘Leak source undetermined, roof replacement proposal’ on the contract and work order. On the day of install, the Project Coordinator should further investigate to find the source and communicate their finding to the customer.</li>
</ul>
