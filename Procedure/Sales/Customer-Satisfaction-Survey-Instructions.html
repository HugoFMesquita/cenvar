<p>CSS Survey instructions.&nbsp; (This may be reworded slightly to fit what is comfortable, but the substance of the questions should not change).&nbsp; Feel free to have conversational dialogue and ask follow up questions about the issues and highlights they bring up in the open ended questions.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, this is ________ with Cenvar.</p>
<p>I’m Chris Good’s assistant and I’m calling to see how we did on your recent roof replacement. Do you have a minute to answer a few questions?</p>
<p>1.Based on your experience, would you recommend us to your friends and family? (If they answer yes and just start talking, let them talk and make notes about what they liked and didn’t like so you can go back and fill in the appropriate sections of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189BX1JYKLntQ83QmZw4uKQTMOCi3Ii-IANQ1D0Fu4II/edit#gid=460477874">CSS spreadsheet</a>).</p>
<p>If they answer “<strong>yes</strong>”:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Would “satisfied” or “impressed” best describe how you feel about your experience?</p>
<p>3. If they answer “impressed”, is there anything (you can think of) that we could have done better?</p>
<p>4. If “<strong>no</strong>”: &nbsp; Please tell me about the problems you had.&nbsp;Be empathetic and ask follow up questions.</p>
<p>5. If “Satisfied”, is there anything you can think of that we could have done to impress you?</p>
<p>As they describe all of the highlights and or issues, any subject, for which there is a question, that they mention in a positive manner mark “excellent” and any subject they mention in a negative manner mark “poor”. Leave blank any CSS subject that they do not mention or mention in a neutral manner.</p>
