<p>The current snippets are:</p>
<h2><strong>Roof not to spec</strong></h2>
<p>It is hereby noted and acknowledged that the customer has elected to have the roof installed in a manner that does not comply with Manufacturer Specifications. This may negatively affect the extended material defect warranty coverage provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<h2><strong>Mixed Materials workmanship warranty</strong></h2>
<p>The 50 year workmanship warranty applies exclusively to the shingle portion of this roof. All other roofing systems installed on this roof shall have a 7 year workmanship warranty period.</p>

<h2><strong>Faux stone chimney that is leaking</strong></h2>
<p>This structure has a faux stone chimney that is leaking. Faulty flashing may be the cause. The flashing is permanently cemented behind the stone. In order to replace it, you will need to hire a mason, at your expense, to remove the stone from, at a minimum, the bottom 6 inches of the chimney. After the roof is replaced, the mason must come back to re-install the stone. We strongly recommend repointing and sealing the entire chimney with masonry sealant after the stone has been replaced.</p>
<h2><strong>Faux stone chimney that is not leaking</strong></h2>
<p>This structure has a faux stone chimney that is not leaking. We will do our best to save the existing flashing. It is possible that the flashing, which is permanently cemented behind the stone, will be damaged during the roof demolition process. In the event the flashing is knowingly or unknowingly damaged, you will need to hire, at your expense, a mason to remove the stone from, at a minimum, the bottom 6 inches of the chimney. Upon the removal of the stone, Cenvar will return to redo the area around the chimney and install new flashing. Cenvar will be responsible to fix any interior damage from any leaks that may have resulted, and there will be no charge for us coming back to install new flashing. We strongly recommend repointing and sealing the entire chimney with masonry sealant after the stone has been replaced.</p>
<h2><strong>Stone chimney that is currently leaking</strong></h2>
<p>This structure has a stone chimney that is either currently leaking, or the structure is such that we cannot ascertain that it is not. Due to the uneven shape of stone that is prone to catch water, and the porous nature of the mortar, it is our experience that stone chimneys leak at a very high rate. Most stone chimney leaks are not caused by roof flashing issues, but rather by leaks through the masonry. We cannot guarantee that replacing your roof will fix the leaks in your masonry chimney. Masonry leaks can only be fixed by repointing the chimney and sealing it with masonry sealer.</p>
<h2><strong>No skylight trim</strong></h2>
<p>We do not do any interior trim work with our skylight replacements. You may need to hire a trim carpenter to trim the interior of the skylight after we have installed it.</p>
<h2><strong>Low slope metal</strong></h2>
<p>For the metal roof quoted, the roof pitch of this structure is lower than recommended by the International Roofing Code. In the event that water intrusion results from water jumping the rib or seam, that leak, and/or damage, will not be covered by our warranty. All other material and workmanship warranties remain in full effect.</p>
<h2><strong>Flashing</strong></h2>
<p>There are one or more areas on your home where the siding meets the roof and needs to be flashed to keep out water. Although flashing can be placed over top of the bottom row of siding, it looks far better if flashing is placed behind it. Unfortunately, the siding is in a condition such that it may be damaged in the process of loosening it sufficiently to place the flashing behind it. In this event, the cost to replace the damaged siding is not included in this contract.</p>
<h2><strong>Seasonal Discount</strong></h2>
<p>The seasonal discount portion of this proposal is contingent upon the roof being installed as soon as is possible after the contract is signed, and in addition, the roof being installed before March 31st. (The discount shall remain in effect if the delay is a result of material shortage or some other delay from Cenvar Roofing)</p>
