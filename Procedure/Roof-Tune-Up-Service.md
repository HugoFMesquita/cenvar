## **Roof Tune Up Service Specifics:**

The Roof Tune Up service will not require a full estimate.

The Roof Tune Up service includes the following 6 items:

1\. Clear roof of all debris.

2\. Re-caulk counter flashing and exposed nails.

3\. Pull and reset nail-pops.

4\. Replace cracked pipe boots.

5\. Test power fans, and set thermostat at correct temperature.

6\. Perform visual roof inspection.

The Roof Tune Up service is only provided for shingle or metal roofs.

The Roof Tune Up service includes any pipe rings, pipe boots, caulking, and nails in the cost of the roof tune up.

Any additional material (shingles, etc.) or service (repairs, etc.) that is needed will require a formal Cenvar Roofing repair estimate.

Because a roof estimate is not needed, the work is mostly labor, materials will be minimal, therefore the pay will be 50% instead of the normal 28-32%.

The Roof Tune Up service proposal and report forms are located in Job Progress.
