<h2><strong>I can’t remember my Wiki password</strong></h2>
<p>If you cannot remember your Wiki password, please contact Isaac Otey-Hall who can reset your password for you. 434-282-8866 or Isaac@cenvarroofing.com</p>
<h2><strong>How do I find a specific Wiki Page</strong></h2>
<p>Type any key word into the search field at the top of the Home page to find specific Wiki pages.</p>
<p>The wiki platform contains a “full text” search. Any word contained within the text of a wiki is searchable unless it is included in an image, such as a screenshot. Tags can be added, but only needed when the word is not present in the title, description or typed text of the wiki.</p>
<p>Note: The full text search primarily searches for complete words. Partial words may or may not provide the anticipated results.</p>
<p>If you cannot find a specific page using a specific key word, please contact Denise Collins so that she can add the key word to the page: denise@cenvarroofing.com</p>

<h2><strong>What do I do if I find an error or incomplete information on a Wiki page?</strong></h2>
<p>Each page has a comment section at the bottom. Please take advantage of this feature to enter errors, additional information, or questions. By working together on this initiative, wiki content can be made better for everyone.</p>

<h2><strong>More Information</strong></h2>
<p>Cenvar Roofing has changed their wiki platform to wiki.js using a PostgreSQL relational database system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “folder” menu displayed on the left side of the wiki is used for naming/organizing content only; it does not contain an actual file structure. For example, a file path could be created as Policy/Vendor/working-with-vendors, even if there isn't an actual Policy/Vendor folder.</p>
<p>Links to other wikis can be created in a stable fashion by using the ID number of the wiki instead of the actual link. For example, wiki.cenvarroofing.com<strong>/i/109</strong> &nbsp;or simply <strong>/i/109</strong> will link to the Forms wiki (listing of forms). Then if the Forms wiki is reassigned to a different location, the link remains because it is referencing the document itself, not its location. This is an advantage to having a relational database backing the wiki.</p>
<p>Images and PDFs used in wikis are labeled as “Assets”. If an image link is included, the image displays; a PDF link will only be a link. <strong>Update coming in the future</strong></p>
