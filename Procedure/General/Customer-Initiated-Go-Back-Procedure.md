## When a customer calls to state that they have an issue with a roof that Cenvar Roofing installed:

-   OM: ask the customer which year the roof installation was completed. If it was completed prior to 2019, the job information will be located in a paper file.
-   If the job was completed during or after 2019, the job information will be in Job Progress.
-   OM: ask the customer their name, address, and telephone number.
-   OM: using the gathered information, locate the job file in Job Progress or in the file cabinet.
-   OM: If the file is paper – the customer information must be entered into Job Progress. [_Entering A New Customer & Scheduling an Appointment_](https://wiki.cenvarroofing.com/i/90)
-   Note: If using the paper file to enter the customer information into Job Progress, add a note in the Customer Note field to indicate the paper file information. Example: “This is a go-back from a 2017 paper file. The customer file was pulled & is currently located in the filing cabinet.” [_Entering A New Customer & Scheduling an Appointment_](https://wiki.cenvarroofing.com/i/90)
-   OM: If the customer job has been archived in Job Progress, you must unarchive it before you can move forward.
-   OM: Move the customer job to the ‘Invoiced: Job Problem’ stage in Job Progress.
-   OM: Assign the customer job a go back flag in Job Progress.
    -   **Note**: There are 2 Job Progress go back flags:
        -   Anything taken care of in 1 trip is assigned a “Minor go back flag“
        -   Anything taken care of in more than one trip is assigned a “Major go back flag“.
-   **OM**: **Add detailed notes in the JP “Job Notes” section, describing the customer telephone call including the issue(s) with as many details the customer can provide.**
-   GM or PC: Required to supply subcontractor / crew with all the necessary go back details to successfully resolve the issue. GM or PC must send instructions, to include job name, job address, photos of all problem areas, detailed description of all issues, and any other pertinent information related to solving the problem.
-   GM: Create a work order describing the go back and any applicable material list.
    -   Attach any photos of the actual areas that need to be addressed to the Work Order. [_Creating a Work Order With Attached House Photo in Job Progress_](https://wiki2.cenvarroofing.com/i/219)_._
-   The GM will daily monitor the ‘Invoiced: Job Problem’ stage until the job issue is resolved and the customer is happy.
-   **Note: Any time anyone (General Manger, Office Manger, etc.) moves a job into the ‘Invoiced: Job Problem’ stage in Job Progress (for any reason), that person is responsible to make detailed Job Notes explaining why the job is in this bucket, and to document all issues.** 
-   **GM & OM are required to add Job Notes regularly to record any and all updates on the progress towards resolution of the problems.**
-   The job will move through the Job Progress stages by following the normal process.

## **The Go Back workflow in Job Progress is as follows:**

GM / OM: Move the customer job to the ‘Invoiced: Job Problem’ stage in Job Progress.

OM: It is the responsibility of the Office Manager to follow the go-back, and move the job through the Job Progress stages.
