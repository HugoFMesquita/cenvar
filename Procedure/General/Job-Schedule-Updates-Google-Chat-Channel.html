<p>Project Coordinators are to post their daily job schedule updates in their branch specific ‘job-update’ Google channel.&nbsp;In using this channel, both the General Manager and the Office Manager are kept in the loop and can see all job updates immediately, know how each job is progressing, and are alerted to any job issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who uses the job-update Google channel? </strong>GM, OM, &amp; PC’s</p>
<p><strong>What do I post in the channel?</strong> PC’s should post any daily job schedule updates, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lorenzo job will finish today.</li>
  <li>Lorenzo job is on track to finish tomorrow.</li>
  <li>Lorenzo job is on track to finish early.</li>
  <li>Lorenzo job is running behind, and will be a half day tomorrow because of XYZ…</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When do I post my job schedule updates? </strong>PC’s are required to post all job scheduling updates in the channel daily by 3:00pm.</p>
<p><strong>When does this new process start? </strong>Effectively immediately.</p>
<p><strong>The branch specific job-updates Google channel is only for information pertaining to daily scheduling updates. </strong>Any information or questions related to job ‘problems’ can be sent in the branch specific Google channel.</p>
<p><strong>Helpful tip: </strong>The OM can also use the branch specific job-updates Google channel to send photos of the updated job board when changes are made.</p>
