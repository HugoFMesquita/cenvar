<h2>Customer Notes: All Positions</h2>
<p>Each time that a customer is contacted, a customer ‘note’ must be added in Job Progress detailing the call.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Example 1: ‘This customer is hard of hearing.’</li>
  <li>Example 2: ‘This customer is Chris’s cousin who had their roof replaced by us last year.'</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, any and all items or issues pertaining to a job must be added as a detailed job ‘note’ in Job Progress.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Example 1: ‘This job was moved due to weather from this date to this other date.’</li>
  <li>Example 2: ‘Customer stated that they will send in their payment this Friday.' <mark class="pen-green">Job Step by Step Workflow</mark></li>

  <li>No jobs that have been estimated should be in “Estimate Appointment Scheduled”.</li>
  <li>Every job in “Signed Contracts” financials must match the Proposal’s “Agreement Amount”.
