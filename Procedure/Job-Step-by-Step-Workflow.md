## Customer Notes: All Positions

Each time that a customer is contacted, a customer ‘note’ must be added in Job Progress detailing the call. 

-   Example 1: ‘This customer is hard of hearing.’
-   Example 2: ‘This customer is Chris’s cousin who had their roof replaced by us last year.'

Additionally, any and all items or issues pertaining to a job must be added as a detailed job ‘note’ in Job Progress. 

-   Example 1: ‘This job was moved due to weather from this date to this other date.’
-   Example 2: ‘Customer stated that they will send in their payment this Friday.' [Job Step by Step Workflow](/i/70)
