<h2><strong>How to add an employee to the pay sheet:</strong></h2>
<p>To begin, add an employee by typing their name in an available "Employee Name" field on the “Payroll” Tab.</p>
<ul>
  <li>See the below example highlighted in yellow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By adding the employee to the proper line, the numbers will automatically tabulate on all the other sheets that are necessary .</p>
<p>Once you have filled in this information, notify Justin Heavner at 434-610-9657, and provide him with all pay information so that he can tabulate the pay sheet.</p>
<p>Add new hourly employees, repairman, or subs by filling in the appropriate fields also located on the payroll tab.</p>
<ul>
  <li>See the below second example.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to fill out hours per position:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Project Coordinators:</strong></h3>
<p>For each PC that you have, please fill in the exact hours that they worked the previous week on the “(Newest) Project Managers” tab.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This will allow for their bonuses and pay to populate.</li>
</ul>
<p>For new PMs, pay will only populate when you let Justin know to update the pay sheet to reflect these changes.</p>
<p>If there are any sick or vacation days, simply leave the day blank and fill in the notes section on the “payroll” tab to notify them of the situation.</p>
<p>When all hours are plugged in, the hours and bonuses will populate on the “Payroll tab” to generate pay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Repair Team:</strong></h3>
<p>Use the repair division tab when filling in the payroll for your repair team.</p>
<p>NOTE: There are 2 parts to correctly calculate your repair teams pay.</p>
<p>Fill in the 1<sup>st</sup> section with all the repair billing that the crew worked on during the last week.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are several categories you can place it in under the total billed to help you account for each specific situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The repairman are located directly underneath of the total billed which allows you to allocate a specific % to each repairman for what they billed.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL BILLING SHOULD NOT HAVE AN ALLOCATION OF MORE THAN 32% to each branch’s repair teams.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anything that is over will result as an overpayment as part of the piecework section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill in the 2<sup>nd</sup> section with the total hours for each repairman that they worked in the previous week.</p>
<p>All repairman are hourly and are directly affected when hours are not populated.</p>
<p>When all of the hours plugged in, the pay sheets will calculate a bonus and send it over to the “Payroll Tab” for each repairman.</p>
<p>DO NOT POPULATE the payroll tab manually with hours or bonuses as this could result in payroll mistakes.</p>

<h3><strong>Subs Payout Structure</strong></h3>
<p>Use the Subcontractor Contract information to populate their specific payout structures.</p>
<p>When entering the name on the “Payroll” tab, the name of the sub should automatically populate in this sheet.</p>
<p>Once you have agreed upon pricing with the sub, simply fill out this sheet so that the correct payout will generate for each specific subcontractor.</p>
<p>The correct payout will automatically populate using the data that you have keyed into the sheet.</p>
