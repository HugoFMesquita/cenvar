  <li>The General Manager's KPIs will be evaluated based on a one-year rolling average. If performance falls below the minimum goal, the General Manager will be placed on a 90-day probationary period. Failure to meet the minimum goal by the end of probation will result in termination. Additionally, a General Manager may not be placed on probation more than twice within a calendar year.</li>
