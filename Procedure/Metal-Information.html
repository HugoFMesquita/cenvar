<h2><strong>Cenvar Roofing Metal Installation specifics:</strong></h2>
<p>Cenvar installs <strong>metal rib panels</strong> ("screw down") and <strong>Snaplock</strong> ("standing seam")</p>
<p>Inside closure strips should be used for eaves only and universal closure strips everywhere else.</p>
<p>Standard screw down master rib panels can be installed down to 3/12 pitch using our standard installation practices.</p>
<p>1" profile Snaplock can be installed down to and including 3/12 pitch.</p>
<p>Snaplock jobs will no longer use nail strips but use 26g with a clip system to alleviate any "oil canning" issues. To determine the number of clips per job: Take the total square of the roof, multiply that number by 12 then divide by 16.</p>
<p>Low pitch guidelines for metal roofing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2/12 &amp; 1/12 pitch requires the use of 1.75" Snaplock.</li>
  <li>We do not install metal roofing under 1/12 pitch.</li>
  <li>We do install ice and water shield over the entire facet of anything less than 4/12 pitch.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Metal Labor &amp; OP:</strong></h2>
<p>For metal roofs: labor is figured and paid on actual square footage.</p>
<p>The labor figure on the estimate, work order, and payroll should all be the actual square footage amount.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The estimate macro in Job Progress reflects this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Labor should be figured on actual square footage for master rib and standing seam.</p>
<p>OP should be figured on actual square footage for master rib and standing seam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>General Metal Guidelines:</strong></h2>
<p>Due to color variations and metal profiles not matching properly, we will not mix vendors for any metal jobs.</p>
<p>All 24-gauge roofing systems will be sold with 24-gauge panels and 24-gauge trim. 24-gauge roofing systems will no longer be sold with 29-gauge trim.</p>
