<p>When a customer job is being actively worked on, the job should be located in the ‘<strong>Work In Progress’</strong> stage in Job Progress.</p>
<h2><strong>Once the job has been completed</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Project Coordinator will ‘flag every job’ with one of two job flags to indicate if the job is ready for the invoice to be sent or if there is an issue that needs to be addressed:</strong></p>
<p>Finished - no issues or problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>Finished with a problem - issues or problems that need to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is the Project Coordinator responsibility to add a Job Note explaining the problem in great detail.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Each day&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Office Manager will review all jobs in the ‘Work In Progress’ stage, and check to see which jobs have been completed and to see which flags have been added to each job.</strong></p>
<p>Jobs flagged with: Job 100% complete:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OM creates the customer invoice which automatically time stamps with a date in Job Progress.</li>
  <li>OM sends the invoice to the customer.</li>
  <li>OM moves the job to the ‘Invoiced: Post-work Follow-up Required’ stage in Job Progress.</li>
  <li>Sales rep continues with the follow up process.</li>
  <li>In the event a problem arises after a job has been flagged “finished”, been invoiced, and been moved to the “Invoiced : Post-work Follow-up Required” stage, it will be moved backwards into the “Invoiced: Job Problem” stage and a job note will be added detailing the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Jobs flagged with: Job complete, but with issues</strong></h2>
<p>OM creates the customer invoice which automatically time stamps with a date in Job Progress.</p>
<p>OM does NOT send the invoice to the customer.</p>
<p>OM moves the job to the ‘Invoiced: Job Problem’ stage.</p>
<p>The GM will daily monitor the ‘Invoiced: Job Problem’ stage until the job issue is resolved and the customer is happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GM &amp; OM should add Job Notes regularly to record any and all updates on the progress towards resolution of the problems.</p>
<p>Once all issues are resolved for any job in the “Finished, with Problem” stage, the OM will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>change the invoice date to the date the issue was resolved.</li>
  <li>send the invoice to the customer.</li>
  <li>move the job to the ‘Invoiced: Post-work Follow-up Required’ stage in Job Progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sales rep continues with the follow up process.</p>
<h2><strong>It is the responsibility of the branch to </strong><a href="/i/26">collect all invoice payments</a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Branches are required to do everything that they can to proactively collect invoice payments within 30 days from the invoice date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every past due invoice / customer on the aging report should be called by the Sales Representative/General Manager.</p>
<p>GMs will require Project Coordinators /&amp; Sales Representatives to ask for payment during each follow up telephone call.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Once the job has been invoiced and is moved to the ‘Invoiced: Post-work Follow-up Required’ stage in Job Progress, Corporate will monitor the financial aging reports, and will follow the time stamped date recorded on each invoice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li>30 Days: Corporate will send a customer statement with a reminder to pay at 30 calendar days past the invoice date, via USPS &amp; email. (see below for additional details)</li>
  <li>60 Days: Corporate will send a 2nd statement with a reminder to pay along with a threatening letter to pay or be sent to collections at 90 calendar days past the invoice date via USPS &amp; email.&nbsp; (see below for additional details)</li>
  <li>90 Days:&nbsp; Corporate will send the account to the attorney’s office to proceed with the collection process.&nbsp; (see below for additional details)</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Any time anyone moves a job into the problem stage (for any reason), that person is responsible to make detailed Job Notes to document all issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of the General Manager &amp; Sales Representative to actively monitor and proactively collect all receivables until they go to collections at 90 calendar days.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate</strong> will send the <strong>Receivables Issue Sheet</strong> each week to General Managers by <strong>12:00pm Tuesday</strong> containing a list of all jobs that are past due, and are <strong>not </strong>in the job problems&nbsp;stage.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>General Managers have until <strong>12:00pm Thursday</strong> to make any necessary updates to the jobs, including moving jobs into the correct Job Progress stage.</li>
  <li>All jobs that are past due, and are not in the Job Progress job problems stage will be sent a statement or sent to collections.<ol>
      <li><strong>30 Day: </strong>30 day customer notices will be sent to customers that are past due 25-32 days.</li>
      <li><strong>60 Day: </strong>60 day customer notices will be sent to customers that are 55-62 days past due +/-1 or 2 days.</li>
      <li><strong>90 Day:</strong> All customers that are 88-95 days past due to be sent to collections every Thursday with <strong>rare </strong>exceptions.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Cenvar Corporate will move all invoice due dates in Quickbooks when they are in the "Problem Jobs" bucket. When the "problem job" comes out of the "problem jobs" bucket Cenvar Corporate will put the current date as the due date so the aging process starts from the current date.</p>
<p>Cenvar Corporate is responsible to send statements, receive payments, and send to collections. They are not responsible for managing/calling for payments, or researching details by digging, prompting or requesting information from the General Managers.</p>

<h2>Unpaid Invoices</h2>
<p>When a customer's outstanding invoice becomes 60 days and 90 days past due, the General Manager and Project Coordinator earnings for the job will be deducted accordingly.</p>
<p>At 60 days, the outstanding invoice will be sent to Cenvar Corporate for internal collection attempts, which will result in a 50% loss of earnings for that job (PC: daily pay rate, GM: quarterly bonus).</p>
<p>At 90 days, the outstanding invoice will be sent to collections, which will result in a 100% loss of earnings for that job (PC: daily pay rate, GM: quarterly bonus).</p>
<p>Any jobs that are sent to collections do not pay commission, and they come directly off of the profit/loss sheet as a ‘sent to collections’ expense. The expenses associated with the job do not come off of the P&amp;L.</p>
