<h2><strong>How are the jobs selected in Job Progress for the CRM audit?</strong></h2>

Anything less will be scored on filling each field out, or if it is not filled out, will automatically get the score of their estimating accuracy below. For those above 85% , will automatically get 100% on the&nbsp;measurements on the next audit as well.</li>

<h2><strong>Job Progress (CRM) Audit FAQs</strong>:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Can I look at the the Job Progress Audit?</strong> Yes, absolutely! Here is a tutorial that shows how you can navigate the <a href="https://wiki.cenvarroofing.com/2021/02/25/crm-audit-viewing-tutorial/">Job Progress Audit</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>I'm a Project Coordinator, and I would like to know how the auditor decides what pictures are needed for a specific job? </strong>The auditor (and the Project Coordinator) will look at the proposal to see what the proposal specifies, and the <i><strong>required </strong></i>pictures will be based off that. It does NOT have to do what is checked/not checked on the PC checklist.</li>
  <li><strong>How can you tell whether a job is placed in the correct Job Progress stage? </strong>The auditor follows the job in Job Progress from the beginning stages all the way through to the signed contract. If the job is in "estimate appointment scheduled" stage, but has a proposal in that job, the audit will be marked as not being in the correct stage. If the job is in "estimated: sales f/u required" and there is a signed proposal in that job, the audit will be marked for not being in the correct stage.</li>
  <li><strong>Why do I need to add notes to the estimate?</strong> When we put notes on the estimate, they will automatically transfer to the work order. This way we are not possibly forgetting anything by the time we would have to fill the work order&nbsp; out.</li>
  <li><strong>Does the customer need to actually sign the proposal, or is it sufficient that they 'accept the proposal' in Job Progress?</strong> &nbsp;There have been instances where the customer has 'accepted the proposal', but did not sign the contract due to an old computer, phone, etc. We need a signed copy of the contract every time because in cases of non-payment, we have nothing to show that they agreed to pay for our services. In these types of scenarios please upload a paper copy of the proposal.</li>
  <li><strong>How can I rename a photo in Job Progress from my cell phone? </strong>Follow the below video tutorial showing how to rename a photo in the app. From photos, hold down the image and the rename option will pop up.</li>
