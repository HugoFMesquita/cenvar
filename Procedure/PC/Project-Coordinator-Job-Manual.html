<h2>Abbreviated PC Responsibilities</h2>
<p><strong>1. Call the customer the day before:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let them know the time of arrival, ask them “is there anything you’d like me to know,” and tell them to call if they need anything at all; you’re at their service.</p>
<p>If you can't get them on the phone, leave a message and a text. Let your foreman know if there is anything he should be specifically aware of on the job.</p>
<p><strong>2. Check the work order/material list either the day before or the morning of the job:</strong></p>
<p>This allows you to know what you need to have in your truck materials-wise that Ravnec won’t deliver and to double check the sales notes on the work order.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Send a work order to the foreman the day before the job:</strong></p>
<p>Add extra notes via text if necessary so the crew can be more prepared. You can also send all the work orders in order the week before if your foreman would prefer to plan for the coming week ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Call the customer the morning of the job:</strong></p>
<p>Let them know we are on the way. If they don’t answer, send a text. Make sure that your crew is ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>5. Put extra materials (if needed) in the truck and check the materials list:</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNdFPOXRVBLQ3d0JUoFf8RaNT8ffjjlCNMIHx-MWvC8/edit"><u>Project Coordinator Truck Stocking Checklist</u></a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. Go to the job site and meet with customers:</strong></p>
<p>Take time to ask them if they have any concerns.</p>
<p><strong>7. Check materials delivered on site and check the materials list on Job Progress:</strong></p>
<p>If some are missing, G-chat the branch chat and go get needed materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Take pictures of materials, receipts, signs, and the house before, during, and after work:</strong></p>
<p>Make notes of anything that is pertinent like damages that are already present before work begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Upload pictures taken to Job Progress.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. Put plywood over AC units to keep debris off. Make sure the AC unit can still function. Also put OSB over windows, glass doors, newly painted deck, etc as needed.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Put the Cenvar sign out in front of the house. Move the bucket from scheduled to work in progress via Job Progress.</strong><br><br><strong>12. Fill out the <u>PC checklist</u> as you go while on site.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Project Coordinator Job Site Checklist is a form in Job Progress located in Forms and Proposals.</p>
<p><strong>13. Update branch G-chat at 3pm about jobs that day. Roof status, etc.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>14. If finishing other jobs quickly, call customers later in the week to see if they are good with you starting early, then tell the branch office manager:</strong></p>
<p>Make sure materials are delivered by keeping Ravnec updated 3 days in advance. Check travel time and inform the crew.</p>
<p><strong>15. Complete scheduled final walk-throughs for the day. You can do this via phone call if the customer is not at home.</strong></p>
<p><strong>16. After the final walk-through:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask them about payment options. They can give you a check, mail it, deliver it in person to the office, or pay online.</li>
  <li>Pick up materials (sometimes get crew to do this) at the job site.</li>
  <li>Send Google reviews to customers via Chekkit. The following day, text the customer and ask them if they were able to see the Google review link.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>17. If a customer does not want a final walk-through, pick up, or get crew to pick up, leftover materials:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing a final walk-through allows you to get eyes on the property post-installation to check the quality of the job completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>18. After walk-through, upload materials left over immediately on payroll or by filling out the material return list on Job Progress:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add extra wood costs to the total invoice. It's an additional $65 per additional OSB over the two we provide for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>19. Let the Finance Channel know if the customer is ready for financing (if using a financing option).</strong></p>
<p><strong>20. Drop off unused materials at the shop from a given job.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>21. Have all payrolls, PC checklists, and final walk-throughs for the week done by Friday or Sunday at the latest. Get the guys to sign safety sheets once a week at the end of the week. When done, upload to G-chat (in crew safety meeting report submissions):</strong></p>
<p>Take an hour at the end of each Friday to check that all payrolls, PC checklists, and final walk-throughs are completed for every job that week. If necessary, call customers who haven’t paid.&nbsp;</p>
