<h2><strong>Before the Job starts</strong></h2>
<p>Contact the customer by phone the day before and cover the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduce yourself as the PC who will be handling their job and ensure the customer has your contact phone number.</li>
  <li>Go over the contract: shingle color, drip edge color and ventilation type and any special instructions the sales person included.</li>
  <li>Instruct the customer what you need from them, move cars out of the way etc.</li>
  <li>Ask if the customer has any specific questions, concerns or requests before the job starts.</li>
  <li>Tell the customer about the English speaker on the crew.

  <li>Set expectations for what time you will first get there and the amount of time you will spend there throughout the day.</li>
  <li>Ask them how often they would like you to check in with them by phone, and if they would like you to text them progress pics etc.</li>
  <li>Tell them you will follow up by phone the day after the job is complete, and during that follow up call you will set an appointment within five business days to do a walkaround with them.</li>
  <li>Let them know that at that walk around, after they are satisfied, you will collect a check.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>During the Job</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Keep the customer informed, protect their interests.<ul>
      <li>Show up on the job at the time you promised the day before.</li>
      <li>The first time you are on the job, put a sign in the yard, check the material amounts and color to make sure it matches the work order.</li>
      <li>Take and upload to JP the following required pics; front of the house, back of the house, wood replacement, sign in the yard, magnets on the truck, the entire crew in uniform, the entire crew in fall protection safety gear.</li>
      <li>Take (or have the crew take) and upload as many pics of the important work progress steps as you are onsite for, ex. bare deck, ice and water shield, flashed areas, skylights, shingle progress etc.</li>
      <li>Ensure the crew takes the required before and after pics of all wood replacement and uploads them into JP.</li>
      <li>Text the customer the pics of the progress as it happens if they wanted that.</li>
      <li>Talk to the customer any time you see them.</li>
      <li>Check in with the customer by phone as discussed the day before.</li>
      <li>Make sure the workmanship is straight and neat, and that any sloppiness or damage that the customer could catch is caught and fixed.</li>
      <li>Make sure the roof is installed to manufacturer’s specs (to the best of the knowledge you have acquired).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Protect the customers property and make sure that the crew:<ul>
      <li>Covers the decks, sidewalks with OSB and tarps.</li>
      <li>Covers the railings with tarps.</li>
      <li>Cover all areas of yard and/or shrubbery, where shingles are falling, with tarps.</li>
      <li>Make sure covered shrubbery and landscaping doesn’t get overloaded with shingle debris and get smashed.</li>
      <li>Cover the HVAC unit with OSB set at an angle so as not to block air flow.</li>
      <li>Make sure all the gutters are protected from Ladders with stand offs or gutter protectors.</li>
      <li>Make sure the tarps don’t stay on grass or shrubbery any longer than needed so they don’t get burned by the heat.<ul>
          <li>If possible, use a garden hose to spray landscaping and grass after tarps are removed to help prevent them from burning.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure the crew has what it needs to work efficiently.<ul>
      <li>Go over the work order and material list with the crew leader to make sure he understands any special instructions.</li>
      <li>To the best of your ability, monitor the amount of unused material compared to the amount needed.&nbsp; Try to anticipate shortages.</li>
      <li>If shortages are caught, review all material carefully with the crew leader before leaving to get more, so as to make sure you get everything you may need in one trip. (if you are unavailable, arrange for the crew to get their own supplies)</li>
      <li>Communicate regularly with the crew leader and the office manager to keep the crew cranking out work as quickly as possible. Work to arrange the schedule so they can fit more in.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep the crew and the jobsite in compliance with Cenvar Policies.<ul>
      <li>Make sure the crew does not waste material.</li>
      <li>Make sure the crew is in uniform.</li>
      <li>Make sure the crew is in properly adjusted fall protection, attached to properly installed anchor(s).</li>
      <li>Make sure the crew has magnetic Cenvar signs on their trucks.</li>
      <li>Make sure the shingle debris, the raw materials and the unused tools are neatly arranged and not scattered all over the property, so that the jobsite looks neat and safe.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Knock on the doors of all houses adjacent to, behind, and across the street from the jobsite to introduce yourself. Give them a business card or door hanger and invite them to contact you if they have any issues that stem from our jobsite such as blowing trash or some other nuisance. In more rural areas, go to all homes within walking distance.</li>
  <li>Complete go-backs and customer service calls on past jobs as GM assigns.</li>
  <li>When the first 7 things are all done, physically help the crew by cleaning up trash or getting on the roof and “sliding shingles” for a mechanic. (you must be in fall protection to be on the roof).&nbsp; If you are a more experienced PC, you may work as a mechanic alongside the crew doing the more complicated parts of the roof.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Next day after the job</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Call the customer the day after to make sure everything went well and address any immediate questions or concerns they may have. (if they have immediate problems or concerns, arrange to address them and do the walk around ASAP)</li>
  <li>If they have no immediate concerns, set an appointment, based upon your upcoming geographic locations, to meet with the customer within the next 5 business days to do a walk around with the customer.</li>
  <li>Remind the customer that at the walk around after everything is taken care of, you will collect the check.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>At the Walk Around</strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Check over everything with the customer; neatness of installation, clean up, property damage etc.</li>
  <li>Make sure all of the leftover material has been picked up.&nbsp; If there is any there, load it on your truck and return it to Varcen or your branch.</li>
  <li>Perform a roof inspection.</li>
  <li>Address and fix any small problems they may have.&nbsp; Arrange to have any larger problems fixed, and then schedule another walk around.</li>
  <li>Collect the check at the final walk around after the customer is satisfied.</li>
  <li>As the VERY LAST THING, let the customer know that one of your key performance indicators is how many reviews you can get, because it helps us with our advertising.&nbsp; Tell them it would mean a lot to you if they would do a review for you, and then send them the google review request.</li>
  <li>Fill out the Project Managers Job Site Checklist Form (in Job Progress) after the walk through with the customer.</li>
</ol>
