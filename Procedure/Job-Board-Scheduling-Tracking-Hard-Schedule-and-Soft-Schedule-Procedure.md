**The Sales Representative is responsible to add the customer information to the Soft Schedule Job Board**

-   Customer Name
-   Color of the Shingle (if selected at the time of signing)
    -   \* Any time that the customer selects the shingle color, the Sales Rep is required to update the board with the color.
-   Number of Square

**The Office Manager (OM) is responsible to schedule all jobs, and accurately document the correct information on the branch Job Board.**

-   The Office Manager is responsible to maintain the schedule, and to communicate any and all scheduling changes with the customer.
-   OM is responsible to call the customer if there are any schedule changes due to:
    -   crew is running ahead of schedule.
    -   crew is running behind schedule.
    -   weather delay.
-   OM is responsible to move / rearrange the affected customer on the job board to accurately reflect the revised crew schedule.
-   OM erases & rewrites the calendar on the job board when needed for a new week.
-   \*Because the future cannot be accurately predicted, the Job Scheduled Board changes frequently.

## **Color Selection:**

The Customer Color Selection Policy must be followed for each job.

## Soft Schedule Job Board

The **Soft Schedule Job Board** is the list of customers who have signed the sales contract but are not yet scheduled. The **Soft Schedule** is a list of all future jobs to be scheduled.

-   Sales Rep writes: the customer information on the **Soft Schedule Job Board**.
-   Sales Rep includes: customer last name
-   Sales Rep includes: number of days estimated in job in parenthesis
-   Sales Rep includes: Sales Rep Initials
-   Sales Rep includes: any specific notes (example: metal, + gutters, etc)
-   EXAMPLE: **Camm (1.5) RT** – Camm = customer last name, (1.5) = number of days estimated in the job, RT = initials of sales rep Ryan Thivierge

**The Soft Schedule Job Board is divided into 2 separate lists:**

1.  **Soft Schedule: No Colors** – this is a list of customers who have signed the contract, but have not selected their shingle color yet.
    1.  The OM cannot provide a start date until the customer has selected a shingle color. (see above)
2.  **Soft Schedule: With Color Selected** – this is a list of customers who have signed the contract, have a shingle color selected, but have not been placed on the Hard Schedule Job Board yet.
    -   Once the customer selects the shingle color, the OM moves the customer to the Soft Schedule: With Color Selected list, and they are placed at the bottom of this list.
    -   The OM will work to move customers ‘up’ the list by moving them in order of ‘first come, first serve’.

**VERY IMPORTANT**: **A customer cannot be placed on the Hard Schedule without a color selection.**

-   Customers must understand that they are not in our scheduling queue until they have chosen a color.
-   The customer goes to the back of the line at the time of color selection, not at the time of contract signing.
-   OM: send the updated Material List with updated color selection to: [_delivery@cenvarroofing.com_](mailto:delivery@cenvarroofing.com)
-   OM: add a ‘checkmark’ next to the customer name on the board.

## Hard Schedule Job Board

**The Hard Schedule Job Board is an accurate 4 week schedule of crew roofing jobs. The Hard Schedule is generally a snapshot of 1. last week, 2. the current week, 3. next week, & 4. two weeks out.**

-   Office manager (OM) contacts the customer via telephone to update them with the scheduled job start date.
-   OM writes the customer information on the **Hard Schedule Job Board** to the *right* of the available day / date. *(see below details)*
-   OM locates the customer name on the **Soft Schedule Job Board**, and erases the customer name & information.
-   OM includes: customer last name
-   OM includes: Sales Rep Initials
-   OM includes: number of days estimated in job
-   OM includes: a colored dot to indicate that the material list has been sent to [_delivery@cenvarroofing.com_](mailto:delivery@cenvarroofing.com) . The colored dot is helpful when there are a lot of crews being scheduled at the same time.
-   OM includes: Bring From Shop or Delivery to specify where the materials are being sourced from.
-   EXAMPLE: Camm (1) RT – Camm = customer last name, (1) = number of days estimated in the job, RT = initials of sales rep Ryan Thivierge
