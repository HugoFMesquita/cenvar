<h2><strong>Customer Referrals</strong></h2>
<p>Many times an existing customer will refer a friend, neighbor, or family member to Cenvar Roofing for their roofing needs. While scheduling a new appointment, the Call Center will ask the customer which method they were referred for service. If referred by ‘Existing Customer’ is selected, the Call Center will enter the name of previous customer and will also make a note that a ‘Gift card is needed’ in the available field.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a NOTE in "Job Notes" in Job Progress with the following information:<ul>
      <li>The name of the existing customer who referred them who is to receive a $100.00 Visa gift card.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Set the Job Flag</strong>, "<strong>Referred, Gift Card Needed"</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Job Note / Job Flag will alert the Office Manager to create a line item on the customer's invoice for the referral coupon redemption.</li>
  <li>The Office Manager will notify the Corporate Lead Center to purchase a $100.00 Visa Gift Card to mail to the referring customer.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Marketing Referral Email</strong></h2>
<p>Our Cenvar Roofing Marketing team will send an email to each roof replacement customer once their job is scheduled to remind them of our referral program. (below)</p>
