<h2>Customer Referrals</h2>
<p>Many times an existing customer will refer a friend, neighbor, or family member to Cenvar Roofing for their roofing needs. We promise our customers that they will receive a $100 gift card for referrals; we must make sure we deliver on our promise.</p>
<h3>Initial contact</h3>
<p>While scheduling a new appointment, the Call Center asks the customer how they heard about Cenvar Roofing. If they indicate they were referred by an existing, previous, or current customer, the Call Center will select “Existing Customer” and enter the name of the customer in the drop down menu in Job Progress. If referrals are entered after the initial setup of the customer, the same steps should be followed.</p>
<p>Note: An additional field in Job Progress can be used to specify “Gift card is needed” along with using the “Referred, gift card needed” flag for an additional precaution, but should be able to be phased out.</p>
<p>See <a href="/i/57"><u>Scheduling a Sales Appointment - Customer Call Center (Lead Development), and Office Managers</u></a> and <a href="/i/90"><u>Entering a New Customer &amp; Scheduling an Appointment</u></a> for additional information.</p>
<h3>Reporting</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Finance/Accounting runs a report every Monday that shows customers that have made referrals and send it to the Call Center, similar to the example below.</p>

<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>The Call Center is then responsible for identifying customers who have satisfied the requirements for receiving their gift card:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existing customer has paid in full; and</li>
  <li>Referred customer has at least scheduled an appointment with Cenvar Roofing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Send note with gift card</h3>
<p>The Call Center will handwrite a Thank You card and enclose a $100 Visa gift card.</p>

<h2><strong>Customer Referrals</strong></h2>
<p>Many times an existing customer will refer a friend, neighbor, or family member to Cenvar Roofing for their roofing needs.

  </li>
  <li><strong>Set the Job Flag</strong>, "<strong>Referred, Gift Card Needed"</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Job Note / Job Flag will alert the Office Manager to create a line item on the customer's invoice for the referral coupon redemption.</li>

</ol>
