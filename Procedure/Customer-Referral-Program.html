<h2>Customer Referrals</h2>
<p>Many times an existing customer will refer a friend, neighbor, or family member to Cenvar Roofing for their roofing needs. We promise our customers that they will receive a $100 gift card for referrals; we must make sure we deliver on our promise.</p>
<h3>Initial contact</h3>
<p>While scheduling a new appointment, the Call Center asks the customer how they heard about Cenvar Roofing. If they indicate they were referred by an existing, previous, or current customer, the Call Center will select “Existing Customer” and enter the name of the customer in the drop down menu in Job Progress. If referrals are entered after the initial setup of the customer, the same steps should be followed.</p>
<p>If a GM or Sales Rep discovers a referral that was not entered should contact the Call Center Manager via g chat to ensure the referral is entered and gift card sent.</p>
<p>Note: An additional field in Job Progress can be used to specify “Gift card is needed” along with using the “Referred, gift card needed” flag for an additional precaution, but should be able to be phased out.</p>
<p>See <a href="/i/57"><u>Scheduling a Sales Appointment - Customer Call Center (Lead Development), and Office Managers</u></a> and <a href="/i/90"><u>Entering a New Customer &amp; Scheduling an Appointment</u></a> for additional information.</p>
<h3>Reporting</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Finance/Accounting runs a report every Monday that shows customers that have made referrals, similar to the example below.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>HR is then responsible for identifying customers who have satisfied the requirements for receiving their gift card:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existing customer has paid in full; and</li>
  <li>Referred customer has signed a contract with Cenvar Roofing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The name of anyone who has not received their gift card will be sent to the Call Center Manager.</p>
<h3>Send note with gift card</h3>
<p>The Call Center will handwrite a Thank You card and enclose a $100 Visa gift card.</p>
