</ul>
<h2><strong>Once the customer is ready to Schedule Roof Job</strong></h2>
<p>Look up the desired customer in Job Progress, and make sure you have the Material list.</p>
<p>You need to know the SHINGLE COLOR &amp; TRIM COLOR to determine the DRIP COLOR.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you do not have a drip edge color try to match it to the shingle.</li>
  <li>if you have white trim, you should always match with white drip, brown with brown drip, and black with black drip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Material list: enter the customer shingle color in the first row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the drip edge and enter the drip edge color (White, black or brown)&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the bottom in the notes add:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shingle color</li>
  <li>Drip edge color</li>
  <li>Start Date</li>
  <li>Delivery Date (For ABC SUPPLY)</li>
  <li>Drop off instructions if given by customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click SAVE, click the 3 horizontal dots, then click email to send to your local ABC Supply.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you need assistance with your local ABC Supply contact information, ask your General Manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the customer is scheduled, slide the job from SIGNED CONTRACT to SCHEDULED&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day before the job begins, call and update the customer to tell them the time the crew will be arriving (give yourself a window - typically anytime between 7-8am).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask the customer if the material has been delivered.</li>
  <li>Print and text a picture of the material list to the Project Coordinator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The day of the job, move the job from SCHEDULED to WORK IN PROGRESS.</p>
<p>You should receive updates around 3-3:30 from the Project Coordinator via the branch job-updates Google chat channel.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The PC will let you know how much decking was replaced, if any was replaced, and if the crew is on schedule.</li>
  <li>This call will prepare you for updating the next customer.</li>
</ul>
