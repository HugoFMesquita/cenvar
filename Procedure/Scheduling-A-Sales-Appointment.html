      <li>Sales Representative appointments to be scheduled anytime between 8:00am and 4:30pm, while allowing one and a half hours for the sales appointment + drive time. This is to allow each individual sales representative to maximize the number of appointments each day.</li>

<h2><strong>Various Call Center Policies:</strong></h2>
<p>When scheduling sales representative appointments, the daily appointment schedules must be filled as follows: Senior Sales Representative calendars get filled first, then they are to be filled based on individual Sales Representative conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer specific "day" preferences will also be taken into consideration.</li>
  <li>Each week the Sales manager will review all sales data, and will discuss the appointment scheduling order with the Marketing Manager to instruct the Call Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>For known repeat customers, the Call Center is to assign the customer’s original (if current) Sales Representative manually. If the customer would like to have a sooner appointment, the Call Center will schedule the first available Sales Representative.</p>
<p>Try to schedule an appointment when all the decision makers can be there.&nbsp; If it is impossible to find an appointment where they can both be there, go ahead and schedule an appointment anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always put into the notes on the calendar, who the salesperson is meeting, and whether they are the only decision maker. &nbsp; That way the salesperson can attempt to reschedule later if he/she wants to.</p>
<p>When a branch sales (or repair) estimate schedule becomes full to one week, it is required that the Customer Call Center Representative create a post in the branch specific General Manager Google channel that there are no more available sales (or repair) appointments available for the next seven days,14 days, 21 days, etc.</p>
<h3>When a customer calls with a complaint about a Cenvar Roofing Representative:</h3>
<p><strong>Sales</strong>: For all Sales Representative related calls such as not being able to reach the representative, not receiving an estimate, or not returning their telephone calls, the Call Center is required to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>send a Google chat to Allen Branscome and the Sales Representative.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Production</strong>: For all production &amp; repair related calls, the Call Center is required to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notify the branch General Manager in the branch specific General Manager Google Chat channel with the customer name and all pertinent information.</li>
  <li>Create a new "Task" for the Cenvar representative in Job Progress to specifically address and rectify the complaint.</li>
  <li>If a customer insists the Call Center provide a roofing quote, we will offer them a no cost roof estimate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Call Center Response: </strong>There are many variables in determining the price for each individual roof. In order to provide you an accurate price, we can schedule an estimator to come to your house at no charge to you, and provide you an estimate for your roof. If it is an inconvenience for you to meet with an estimator in person, we are able to have the estimator come to your house without you present to provide you the price. However, it is better if you are able to be there with the estimator, as there are many things that can affect the price of the roof.</p>

<h2><strong>Policy on home buyers and Realtors representing home buyers:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will we schedule an estimate or a roof inspection for them?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, we will schedule an inspection for a buyer, or a buyer’s Realtor, if either the buyer’s or seller’s Realtor meets us on site, or if we get confirmation directly from the seller or the seller’s Realtor that we are cleared to come at the specified time (the reason we will not accept the buyer’s Realtor scheduling with no meeting or confirmation is that we have had too many homeowners upset at us when we show up and they were not expecting us).</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Will we do a free estimate or inspection for a home buyer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: No. We do not perform free roof inspections. If the home is under contract with contingencies, we will still do an estimate or an inspection, but there will be a $350 charge. The charge will be credited back if the buyer closes on the house and elects to use us to do the work.</p>
