<p><span class="text-huge"><strong>OBSOLETE - As of June 2023, Cenvar Roofing no longer uses Enhancify</strong></span></p>
<h2><strong>Press the link to open the <u>Enhancify</u> website.</strong></h2>
<p>The customer will follow the steps and fill out the application directly on the Enhancify website.</p>
<p>The customer will be asked to choose which of the 3 types of financing options they would like to apply for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct Funding</li>
  <li>Indirect Funding</li>
  <li>Credit Cards</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The 3 financing options are:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Direct Funding</strong>&nbsp; (Through Power Pay)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Up to 15 year payment terms</li>
  <li>Credit Scores of 600 and above</li>
  <li>Rates of 4.99-12.99%</li>
  <li>Once job is complete and the homeowner verifies the completion the loan agency funds us Directly</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loan application is more detailed with more verification</li>
  <li>More work for the sales person</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Indirect Funding</strong> (Wide Spectrum of Personal Loan Lending institutions)</h3>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Credit Card option&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
  <li>0% interest rate up to 18 months</li>
  <li>Application process is simple</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
  <li>Credit Scores above 680</li>
  <li>If they do not pay in full after the 0% period often the interest exceeds 24%</li>
  <li>Convenience fee of 3% charged by us when they pay</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>It is important to continue to emphasize:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Financing through Enhancify is most likely NOT the best option for the customer. We want to continue to express this to the customer.</li>
  <li>BB&amp;T and / or their bank would be the best option for the customer the majority of the time.</li>
</ul>
