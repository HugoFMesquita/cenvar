<h1><strong>Sales</strong></h1>
<p>Prospect reaches out (from marketing, word of mouth, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Lead center agent talks to prospect.</li>
  <li>Agent books appointment.</li>
  <li>Asks if they are interested in solar.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>If prospect wants quick pitch pricing vs in depth</strong></h1>
<ol>
  <li>Let the customer know they can receive a personalized quote to show what it may look like.</li>
  <li>Notify customer that internal design specialist who will be designing their system and proposal will be contacting them to prepare it.</li>
  <li>The internal design specialist calls the customer and asks them to send a utility bill to meet their needs; without it we cannot put together a proper proposal. If a customer does NOT feel comfortable sending a bill, we attempt to professionally guide the customer over to full solar appointment at this time.&nbsp; Some customers may feel more comfortable with their personal information only being shared in person.&nbsp; Roofing estimators are not equipped with time and software access to enter this information properly and guide them through the process of what will fulfill their energy consumption needs.</li>
  <li>Internal design specialist also re-emphasizes the bundle discount $0.25/w when customer does roof and solar with Cenvar (must be roof mount).</li>
  <li>Internal design specialist builds design in Aurora.</li>
  <li>Internal design specialist puts together solar proposal deck.</li>
  <li>Internal design specialist sends deck to both customer and roofing estimator.</li>
  <li>Internal design specialist notifies customers upon review if they would like to learn more in-depth information, we can do a solar specific appointment and pass on if so.</li>
  <li>The roofing estimator takes 10-15 minutes with customers going over the solar proposal.</li>
  <li>If customer wants to move forward with solar more in depth, estimator calls lead center agent to get solar appointment booked.</li>
</ol>
