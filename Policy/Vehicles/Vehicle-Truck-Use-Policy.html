<h2>Prior to Operation</h2>
<p>Every employee who drives a company vehicle must sign a <a href="/i/109">Company Vehicle Use Agreement</a></p>
<p>A new employee is not permitted to drive any company owned vehicle or allowed to be on the job site until the new employee has been properly on boarded at Corporate.</p>
<p>Employee authorizes the company to obtain and review the Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) of the employee.</p>
<p>Employees who drive a Cenvar Roofing vehicle must have a valid and current driver’s license, are expected to drive in a safe and responsible manner, and to maintain a good driving record. Our Auto Insurance company regularly monitors and reviews DMV records to determine if an employee’s personal driving record indicates a pattern of unsafe or irresponsible driving. If an employee has 3 or more driving infractions within 3 years, our insurance company may deem them uninsurable, and could result in possible termination. Examples of driving infractions include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>moving violations (speeding, driving thru red light, etc)</li>
  <li>chargeable accidents ( the driver is determined to be the primary cause of the accident through speeding, inattention, etc.)</li>
  <li>any combination of accidents and/or moving violations</li>
</ul>
<p>All employees who drive a company vehicle will be required to complete and pass a 2-hour online Defensive Driving course, provided by Cenvar, within 90 days of hire. Failure to do so will deem an employee ineligible to drive a company vehicle, which may result in termination.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nsc.org/safety-training/online-training">https://www.nsc.org/safety-training/online-training</a></p>
