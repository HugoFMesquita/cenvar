<h2>After an accident</h2>
<p><strong>All&nbsp;accidents&nbsp;in&nbsp;company vehicles, regardless of severity, must be reported.</strong></p>
<p>First, call 911 to report the accident.</p>
<p>Second, call your General Manager to inform them of the accident. Per the&nbsp;<a href="/i/24">Cenvar Roofing Vehicle / Truck Use Policy</a>,&nbsp;employees are responsible to report all vehicle / asset damage to their branch General Manager. General Managers are required to notify Human Resources within 1 hour of any injury incident or vehicle accident on the Human Resources Google Chat channel.</p>
<p>Third, fill out a Cenvar Roofing <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/cenvarroofing.com/open?id=1pATZ64E6EEATCpVvxHTprT2yS9koQDX_0mURus2cFXk"><u>Vehicle / Asset Accident Report Form</u></a> (located in the vehicle glove box) and give it to your GM to be sent to the Corporate office immediately. If you have been injured as a result of an auto accident, you are required to fill out both the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/cenvarroofing.com/open?id=1pATZ64E6EEATCpVvxHTprT2yS9koQDX_0mURus2cFXk"><u>Vehicle / Asset Accident Report form</u></a>, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="/i/109">First Report of Injury form</a>.</p>
