<h2 class="toc-header" id="truck-vehicle-automobile-asset-transfer-policy"> Truck, Vehicle, Automobile, &amp; Asset Transfer Policy</h2>
<p>General Managers are required to fill out a Cenvar Roofing asset transfer form to transfer a truck, trailer, or company asset to another branch or back to Corporate.</p>
<p>The asset transfer form myst be completed the same day as the transfer.</p>
<p>Any vehicle / asset that is temporarily moving from one branch to another branch must have an asset transfer form filled in by the General Manager who is transferring the vehicle / asset from their location. It is in the GMs best interest to fill in the form, as the branch assigned to the vehicle / asset will be allocated every expense incurred (depreciation, fuel, etc.).</p>
<p>Both managers who are receiving and transferring any asset are required to sign the asset transfer form prior to sending it to the Corporate Office to process the transfer.</p>
<p>With General Manager approval, the Sales team is authorized to temporarily use the Production team's spare trucks within their branch without asset transfer, but they are required to return it back to the branch with a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>General Managers are responsible for the transportation of all asset transfers to their branch.</p>
<p>Corporate is responsible for the transportation of all asset transfers from the branch back to Corporate.</p>
<p>General Managers are required to keep assets in their branch fleet for a minimum of 6 months before transferring it out of their branch unless it has been involved in a catastrophic event.</p>
<p>When an asset is transferred back to Corporate, it is the responsibility of the General Manager to ensure the asset is cleaned of all trash and materials.</p>
<p>The Operations team will be intentional about making sure that any assets transferred to the branches are up to date and in good working order. If there are any issues with the transferred assets that you receive, notify Ryan Thivierge directly <a href="mailto:ryan@cenvarroofing.com">ryan@cenvarroofing.com</a>.</p>
