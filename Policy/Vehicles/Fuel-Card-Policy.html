<p>Company fuel cards are only to be used to fill up work vehicles with fuel, purchase car washes, pay for oil changes, purchase vehicle fluids, and purchase other small parts and services.</p>
<p>Fuel cards must remain in the vehicle at all times in the visor card holder on the driver's side.</p>
<p>If the vehicle fuel card is missing or damaged, contact the asset manager immediately to order a replacement.</p>
<p>It is against company policy to use fuel cards to fill up your personal vehicle.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the accounting department regularly reviews the fuel card Sheetz fill to look for purchase irregularities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time the company fuel card is used, you are required to enter an accurate odometer reading at the fuel pump.</p>
<p>Never share your PIN with anyone including other employees.</p>
<p>The Sheetz (Wex) card is accepted at 95% of U.S. gas stations, and 45,000 service centers.
