<h2><strong>Before, During, and After The Job</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Before the Job</strong></h3>
<p>Check over the next job in your schedule the day before you start it. Check the salesman's math on the roof drawing, check the material list to make sure it matches the drawing, call the salesman if you notice anything unusual, make a list of any special tools or materials you will need for the morning.</p>
<p>When you arrive on the job site, measure the roof and check it against the salesman's drawing.</p>
<p>Send a message via your branch Google Chat channel to the GM and the salesman to inform about any mistakes you find in the salesman's work or measurements.</p>
<p>Project Coordinators are no longer required to be at the job site first thing in the morning before the crew, but are encouraged to do so when possible. The Project Coordinator is required to call the customer the day before to set expectations. Upon arrival to the customer's property, (if the customer is home) do a walk around with the customer to acknowledge pre-existing damage, confirm details of the roofing contract (example: not doing porch on back), and discuss any abnormal things with the customer.</p>
<p>Introduce the homeowner to at least crew foreman, preferably the whole crew.</p>
<p>Ask customers if they would like to receive photos of the progress of the crew or any damaged decking.</p>
<p>Address any concerns that the customer may have.</p>
<h3><strong>During the Job</strong></h3>
<p>All reused vents noted in the customer contract must be closely inspected for defects.</p>
<p>Before the job is finished, notify the office manager so that an invoice can be created and emailed to the customer. Notify the Office Manager if the customer needs a paper copy of the invoice.</p>
<p>Project Coordinators are required to leave two unopened tarps behind with the crew when they leave and the roof is still open. This policy includes when the PC leaves the job temporarily to get material. The PC will need to relocate those tarps the next day to make sure they are still intact. Tarps that are used for purposes other than rain will be charged back to the crew.</p>
<p>Project Coordinators must monitor the weather, and keep their truck caulk supply in heated (or at least not freezing) storage when the temperatures drop below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius).</p>
<h3><strong>After the Job</strong></h3>
<p>PCs are required to make a follow up telephone call the day after completing each job:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ask if the customer has "any questions or concerns".<ul>
      <li>If the customer has questions, the PC will answer their questions over the telephone.</li>
      <li>If the customer has concerns, the PC will offer to visit the job site to address them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make the customer aware of any damaged wood found or any changes with the roof.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective 11/21/22, Project Coordinators are required to send <mark class="pen-green">Bird Eye review requests</mark> for 100% of jobs.</p>
<p>If your manager requires it, you must fill out the <mark class="pen-green">Subcontractor / Crew Pay Summary </mark>and have the crew sign the form to verify the information.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility that all leftover material is returned to the shop, and that all unopened material is returned to distribution.</p>
