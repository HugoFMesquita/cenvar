<h2>Sales Representative: During the Sales Estimate</h2>
<p>Sales Representatives are <strong>required</strong> to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the <mark class="pen-green">Sales Estimate Follow Up Procedure</mark>.</li>
  <li>Get on every roof to inspect and perform measurements.</li>
  <li>Measure metal master rib panels exactly by measuring from the edge of the shingles to the middle of the ridge minus 2.5 inches.</li>
  <li>Figure an additional 5% overage when estimating metal jobs.</li>
  <li>Get inside every attic to inspect.</li>
  <li>Create and quote a gutter proposal with every roofing proposal.</li>
  <li>Have Cougar Paws. Cougar Paws must be worn on pitches steeper than 6/12.</li>
  <li>Create a separate gutter job under the customer after a gutter proposal is signed (sold).<ul>
      <li>All Gutter jobs must have their own Job under the customer.</li>
      <li>Note: A separate gutter job will no longer be created along with the roof replacement job at time of original appointment booking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Take at least one photo from the street before the job starts. The Project Coordinator will take at least one photo from the street from the same location when the job is completed. The photos should be labeled ‘marketing’ in the Job Progress photo folder.</li>
  <li>Check the condition of any current gas vent pipe and flashing at the time of the estimate, and will advise the customer if they need to be replaced. The customer will be required to contact their HVAC company to replace any bad gas vent pipes before we replace the roof. <u>We do not replace gas vent pipes.</u></li>
  <li>Be familiar with, and use Job Progress “Snippets” to select and insert into customer proposals for:<ol>
      <li>Roofs not installed to spec</li>
      <li>Mixed material workmanship warranty</li>
      <li>Link to payments</li>
      <li>Faux stone chimney that is leaking</li>

      <li>No Skylight Trim</li>
      <li>Low Slope Metal</li>

      <li>Seasonal Discount</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the <mark class="pen-green">Price Match &amp; Discount Policy</mark>.</li>
  <li>Make note of all reused vents in the contract.</li>
  <li>Obtain General Manager approval for every Eagle View order.</li>
  <li>Follow the <mark class="pen-green">Skylight Policy</mark>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any activity outside of the scope of the original contract must be written up and signed / agreed upon by the homeowner via the ‘Additional Scope of Work Contract’ to the forms and proposal tab in Job Progress. Examples include chimney removal, gutter guard replacement, and satellite removal.</p>
<p>If a Sales Representative uses the Job Progress flag: “No Opportunity”, they must add a note on the job detailing why there is no opportunity. The Sales Representative will then be required to discuss it with the Regional Manager.</p>
<p>Sales Representatives <strong>may</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the repair or replacement proposal for partial roof replacements, but the Sales Representative is ultimately responsible to make sure that the proposal accurately describes everything that is included in the job. <mark class="pen-green">Job Size Policy - Large Projects, Repair vs Replacements, etc</mark><u>.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Sales Representatives should <strong>never</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get on a roof steeper than 9/12 except for walking the valleys or hips.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sales Representative: After the Estimate</h2>
<p>Sales Representatives are required to move a job into the Job Progress “Proposal On Hold” stage, if the job has been submitted to insurance, or if it is on hold for legitimate reasons such as waiting for Eagle Views, etc. Jobs need to flow in and out of this stage as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>
<p>Sales Representatives are required to complete the Material List for all jobs. To do this, Sales Representatives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create one Material List for each job</li>
  <li>Add OSB to the Material List</li>
  <li>Send the Material List to GVRT (Distribution) of materials to be delivered</li>
  <li>Delete the following lines on the Material List:<ul>
      <li>Caulk, Step Flashing, Trim Coil, and any wood other than OSB</li>
      <li>The above items will be delivered by the Project Coordinator assigned to the job.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lynchburg Sales Representatives are required to email the Material List to delivery@cenvarroofing.com. All other branch Material Lists are sent by the branch Office Manager or General Manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sales Representatives are not required to perform post job follow up calls with the customer after the job is completed. Because post job completion follow up calls are performed by Corporate, it is optional for Sales Representatives.</p>
<p>Sales Representatives are responsible to follow the <mark class="pen-green">Receivables Process</mark>.</p>
<h2>Sales Representatives Miscellaneous Policies:</h2>
<p>Effective 9/1/21, all newly signed contracts must match the work order and board for days.&nbsp; All jobs scheduled 9/1/21 and later, the days on the estimate must also match.</p>
<p>For now, if a customer selects options that were not originally estimated, and if it does not affect the number of days, it doesn't need to be updated on the estimate. If the upgraded items change the number of days, the estimate must be updated. (9/16/21)</p>
<p>The maximum price discrepancy between estimated price and proposal price is $10.00. This is to allow for the price to be changed on the proposal to end in a 9 or other number as preferred by some of our sales staff.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Estimating Mule Hide - Mule Hide will be estimated by-the-square at $450/sq. This price includes material, labor, and OP. This all-inclusive price is Job Progress under the Material section of the estimate. When a Mule Hide job is sold, the Sales Representative will need to break out the materials for the material list.</li>
</ul>
