<ul>
  <li>When a customer calls the call center, the agent shall ascertain if the prospective job is majority flat work or majority steep slope.&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Majority steep slope: The lead goes to the residential division.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Majority low slope or flat: It goes to the commercial division.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Either division may elect to quote and produce roofing work of any type and ratio.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sales personnel are not to quote work that their division will not produce.&nbsp;Any work that the division will not produce must be referred to the other division to be quoted and produced.</li>
  <li>When a sales representative from either division refers work to the other division, they shall be paid a commission of 2% of the gross revenue up to a maximum of $3,500.00 in commission paid for a&nbsp; single job.</li>
  <li>If it comes to our attention that the commercial and residential divisions are quoting the same job because of a personal lead, whichever division obtained the lead first shall have the right to bid it, the other will refrain.</li>
</ul>
