<p>Keeping our lead times reasonable is a huge part of powering growth. We track lead times for all sales and production. There are maximum lead time requirements that we will be required to meet 75% of the time and they are measured weekly.</p>
<p>For each category, you can exceed the requirement a total of 13 weeks out of the year and have to stay under the requirements for at least 39 weeks.</p>
<h2>Sales (Repairs and Roofs)</h2>
<p>There shall be at least 6 openings per sales person in the first 7 business days.</p>
<p>An opening is defined as number of spaces left out of three appointments.</p>
<p>If you go to 4 appointments, you will need to pack them into the earlier days to leave space toward the end.</p>
<p>If there are more than two appointments per salesperson out beyond seven days, it will be a “fail” no matter the number of openings.</p>
<h2>Reroofing production</h2>
<p>We need to stay within 6 weeks of backlog.</p>
<p>Backlog is defined as the combination of hard and soft schedule.</p>
<h2>Repairs production</h2>
<p>We need to stay within two weeks backlog.</p>
<h2>Gutters</h2>
<p>We need to be able to install gutters within 7 days of installing the roof.</p>
