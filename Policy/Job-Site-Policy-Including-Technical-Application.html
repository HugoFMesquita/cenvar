<p>When we do a tear off, we tear off everything to the bare wood, including all the old tar paper, nails and as much ice and water shield as possible.</p>
<p>Our standard is to re-deck (complete tear off and replace with new boards) OSB decking and to deck-over (install OSB boards over) plank board decking. Plywood can be used only by customer request. Any rotted plank boarding should be replaced prior to deck-over.</p>
<p>We use drip edge around the entire perimeter of the roof. It is exposed and visible, it must be installed neatly. Pay special attention at the peak and corners. Do not use multiple short sections of Drip Edge. On the rake, start at the bottom with full sections and use full sections the whole way up the rake. Put the cut piece at the very top. Do not run continuous pieces over the ridge. Cut the ridge. Use appropriate colored caulk if necessary to make corners and peaks look neat and clean. Take care when installing drip edge to make sure it is straight and tucked evenly against the rake and fascia. Make sure all ends are cut on an angle to fit whatever it butts up to, including itself in the corners at the gutter.</p>

<p>We use starter strips the whole way around the edge of the roof. We hang the starter strips and the shingles 3/4 inch over the drip edge at the eaves. We hang the starter strips and shingles 3/4” over the drip edge at the rake and eave. We snap lines up the rake to make sure we install the starter strips straight, and then lay the shingles to the starter strips.</p>
<p>Use 5 fasteners for each starter shingle, placed 2” to 3” up from eave’s edge spaced evenly across the starter shingle.</p>

<p>We use 6 nails per shingle in GAF Timberline, and 4 nails per shingle in Owens Corning Tru-Def.</p>
<p>We are extremely picky about shooting the nails in the nail line. At least 5 of every 6 nails in GAF must hit the nail line. Every nail in Owens Corning Tru-Def must hit the nail line. Make sure the nails do not land closer to 2” to the joint of the row of shingles above.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/U4TobpYHx_rbvFkkYvEvJRi-k39dAOIzBXv5AbMAuhb_aHJKAuPRXt9HMc5zCQI08y5yLhu4DX-zDR5ST4qLk9KcZF1nCK8tws2DEI7Nlgh_KEi5KTXNsm0glfd68icb4mRuXOMz"></figure>
<p>We use Ice and water shield: at all eaves, in all the valleys, at all pitch changes, in all flashed areas (walls, chimneys etc.), and around all roof penetrations (pipe boots, vents, skylights etc.). In areas below where the ice and water shield ends, we head lap the ice and water shield over the row of shingles below so that if water gets to the ice and water shield and runs down the roof, it will get kicked out on top of the roof. (If you do not understand, ask your GM.)</p>

<p>We run Ridge Vent the whole way to the end of the peaks. We do not stop it short like some companies do.</p>

<p>If possible, we always replace all vents, power fans, and vent boots, we slide a quick repair ring over all select-a-size vent boots. Lifetime boots do not require a quick repair ring.</p>
<p>We always cut/grind our counter flashing into the masonry.</p>
<p>For GAF shingles, woven valleys are not allowed. Only cut valleys or open valleys.</p>
<p>It is better to replace too much rotten or discolored plywood. It is very difficult to go back to replace more, as it is much easier to replace it as we go. We never replace less than half a sheet. Do not replace small little sections of plywood. Always use at least a half sheet.</p>
<p>We always use 8 or 10 penny ring shank nails to nail OSB or Plywood, and they should be spaced no more than 10” apart to ensure the plywood is nailed sufficiently and that it will not bow or pop up.</p>
<p>We always use H clips when redoing sheathing to prevent buckling sheathing later if sheathing swells.</p>
<p>We can replace only one rafter width on plank boards, because strength is not an issue.</p>
<p>Always replace step flashing when possible.</p>
<p>We may snip step flashing to fit it under J channel. It must never be trimmed less than 1” and should always be trimmed as little as possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Valleys</strong></h2>
<p>Make sure the top of the lapped shingle is at least 8” from the center of the valley.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Eu8zaATOFauaQHDPPcGfQoqSkg8fhRmiV9lNH9sasWwVYkqC2wTj9PVbI2nde-0etdp7KsY-uDPIfn4UPT_bDtEUyNIy2XdumukcyvG-h29Vq_-P18AgOPea8gqFmQOi25zAQHME"></figure>
<p>Leaks will show up in 5-7 years if we fail at this. Keep nails at least 6“out of the center of the valley.</p>
<h2><strong>Shingle Application (Nailing)</strong></h2>
<p>Make sure all nails are on the nail line and spaced pretty evenly. Slow down as much as needed to make sure this happens. *See figure 4 below for the correct fastening pattern. This pattern applies to all slopes less than 21/12.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M6a6JXgiedNqkJlZUKLjxmvIAVXH7eFjjxTqdbDCrsArQAhl1fY1yP2Pmp6LO040Y8uActN989ZXtA4rEqbFjf9a2Rj-ApopwwPZxrChi3WSxAlds8X70jmQteqQgNNgY6U8pF4l"></figure>
<p>Do not over drive or under drive nails.</p>
<p>Make sure the air pressure is adjusted correctly, and the hammer adjustment on the nose of the gun is adjusted properly, so that the nails are set flush with the top of the shingle.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0cEVQExWAR7DfsCHYztmio9xgefaor6QPWUv21zFC6LiQ4pN4MMV0kHfW1Cjri9MMfqO_T2WPuQlT-_ppuybmSnZzTI1pBjQ2urDTF5n9eW2lK1fwX-EOkMsaBbP9mFBmdQgkrAf"></figure>
<p>If a nail is over driven, it must be caulked. If a nail is under driven, it must be set by hand with your hammer.</p>
<p>Make sure the nail gun is held square to the roof so that the nails go in straight and not cocked sideways. Use your hammer to fix any nails that are put in crooked.</p>
<p>Along walls, only nail step flashing on the very edge as far away from the wall as possible. Nails cannot be any closer than 3” from the wall.</p>
<p>Do not go crazy with the nails. For GAF we put in 6 nails per shingle on the line. For Owens Corning, we put 4 nails in the nail line. When installing shingles on the Gable end, do not use multiple nails up the side. For example, when installing a 12” shingle on the end, 3 nails in the nail line is sufficient. Keep all nails at least 2” from the gable end.</p>
<p>All slopes 21/12 and greater, use the six nail pattern and four 1 inch spots of asphalt cement as shown below.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nwBdDX0HM_dcfPAM7eUDAQWJl1eP3UjzkT11X2iTYLl5y7-33_IMKoiqB6r8LnLGGCojyLJ3IgyJl4wXP4COmsip9ElDzFEkpnP7JYTuZT6eXCuvct632sq-6EmFsx3C9sBuya3D"></figure>
<h2><strong>Flashing</strong></h2>
<p>Along walls make sure every shingle gets a step flashing on top of it. Overlap step flashing by at least 2”. Only put one nail on top of the step flashing. Make sure nails are on the outside edge of step flashing (the edge furthest from the wall) Keep all shingle nails at least 4” from the wall.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/etbXEmZMRBHodK4Vdm-ngBOL7_quf8zDjHRSat5Af9pkqpzkq3Ts_aWZXQZ7dm6wflHIeU-d22GL8nxh5XxXHnOa2QI0TKu33jWKGdUiwt-oUNVdc-qi2v9kAzRMsMTV9wn-miWQ"></figure>
<p>We must replace all counter flashing that is not cut into the masonry. We must replace all steel flashing. We must paint all exposed flashing we do not replace, unless it is copper.</p>
<p>All Counter Flashing must be cut into masonry.</p>
<p>Always match the height of the new counter flashing to the height of the old counter flashing.&nbsp; If you must change the height of the counter flashing due to deteriorated masonry, you must have the homeowner sign off before proceeding.</p>
<p>Copper counter flashing must be used on all real stone chimneys.&nbsp; Anywhere copper counter flashing is used, the step flashing must also be copper.&nbsp; On fake stone chimneys, it is best if the stone is popped off and then re-installed over the step flashing, counter flashing is not needed, and aluminum step flashing can be used.&nbsp; If the customer does not want to pop the stones off, copper counter and step flashing must be used.</p>
<p>You must use copper nails with copper flashing. Regular aluminum or steel nails will corrode with copper.</p>

<h2><strong>General</strong></h2>
<p>Starter shingles must be staggered a minimum of 6” from the first course of regular shingles. For GAF, starter shingles are a different length than regular shingles. Pay special attention to this as you run shingles from the bottom so that the butt joints of the starters do not fall within 6” of the butt joints of the first row of shingles.</p>
<p>Use 5 fasteners for each starter shingle, placed 2” to 3” up from eaves edge.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FrwzLQ2CVQeAr1kl7QPQhMWo8Rl8ueWdBUivGREsz-1aLLD1GIi5P2kRwbu-e9vnm8I4QtJBMeEIVQmv3uWAgKmqpOXGCgiHX2NGDvdQ7mYadGtnKSfFUpG0k4tCXhAmLdOymeNv"></figure>

<p>All regular shingles must be staggered (stepped) a minimum of 4 inches.</p>
<p>Be careful that no nails in the row below are within 2” of your joint.</p>
<p>Take special care to install starter shingles very straight when installing starter shingle up gable ends.</p>
<p>Make sure all gable edges (rakes) are cut so that no shingle is exposed outside the starter. Cut shingles even with the starter strip. Never allow them to hang out over the starter. They can be cut up to 1/8” shorter than the starter. Use a straight edge if needed.</p>
<p>We must caulk all exposed nail heads at the bottom of pipe boots, chimney flashing, or wall flashing, etc.</p>
<p>Clean up shall be such that we cannot find shingle or tar paper pieces that are bigger than 1” in diameter.&nbsp; AND we should not be able to find more than one nail per square of shingles that were installed on the roof. If it was a 20 square roof, our customers should not be able to find more than 20 nails in the yard. They should never be able to find ANY nails in the driveway, sidewalks, decks or patios. If they find nails in any of those areas, we have failed.</p>
<p>Always paint plumbing vent pipes brown or black to match the roof color.</p>
<p>When we replace OSB or plywood use ONLY 8 penny ring shank nails, spaced no more than 10” apart. For rafters more than 16” on center, we must use H-clips.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Various Directions</strong></h2>
<p>We will no longer leave one free bundle of shingles for each job.</p>
<ul>
  <li>*If a customer <i><strong>specifically </strong></i>asks for additional shingles, we will leave up to one bundle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep two brand new 20’x30’ tarps on the truck for use in case of unexpected rain.</p>
<p>We do not replace gas vent pipes. The Sales Representative will check the condition of any current gas vent pipe and flashing at the time of the estimate and will advise the customer if they need to be replaced. The customer will be required to contact their HVAC company to replace any bad gas vent pipes before we replace the roof.</p>
<p>Always remove gutter guards prior to beginning to tear off. Carefully re-install them after the roof is complete.</p>
<p>Never cover a hole in the roof deck, that is larger than 1”, with metal or shingles. Any deck board or sheet of plywood with a hole larger than an inch that is not going to be used for a vent or fan must be replaced.</p>
<p>Never install flashing overtop of siding, for any reason, without first clearing it with the homeowner.</p>
<p>Never take trucks, trailers or any equipment off of the homeowner's driveway without permission.</p>
<p>Always make sure you know where the septic tank and field are before taking trucks, trailers or any equipment off the driveway. Never drive anything over septic tanks or septic fields.</p>
<p>Drivers: Always put the automatic transmission trucks in “tow” mode when towing a trailer.</p>
<p>Always re-install satellite dishes on the roof, unless the homeowner tells you not to. Put it back where it was. (If the homeowner is home they can alert you when it is aligned properly. We will not always be able to get it properly re-aligned.&nbsp; The salespeople have made them aware of this and we do not need to pay to have it aligned, the customer will need to call their service provider)</p>
<p>Always keep 3 extra plywood on the trucks/trailers for replacement and covering decks and air conditioner units.</p>
<p>Always cover decks and air conditioner units with plywood. Cover air conditioning units with the plywood sheet set at an angle so as not to block the air flow and burn up the unit. (You can also use an empty pallet with a piece of plywood overtop to cover air conditioner units)</p>
<p>Never set ladders against gutters.</p>
<p>Always hang tarps from the eaves during the tear off process, covering the entire wall, siding, and windows to keep them from getting scratched and dirty.</p>
<p>Tarps are required to be hung on all 2 story homes, or as needed.</p>
<p>There are only two approved methods for removing shingles from the roof. 1). Physically throwing them off the roof or using the Equiptor provided chutes and gutter protectors. Shingles should never be allowed to slide over gutters. On roofs that are so steep the shingles slide down as soon as they come loose and you are not able to install an equipter chute in the area, a wooden dam must be built at the eaves to catch the sliding shingles. A man must work that dam and hand toss the shingles to a tarp.</p>
<p>To protect the customer’s interior, we never leave a roof in underlayment overnight.&nbsp; Everything torn off must be replaced that same day.</p>
<p>For jobs that are more than one day, the biggest messes must be cleaned up at the end of every day to keep from damaging lawns and to allow the homeowner safe ingress and egress to their property in the evenings.</p>
<p>Snow hooks on screw down (MasterRib) metal roofs are to be spaced 18" on center. (Also known as snow hooks, snow cleats, snow bars)</p>
