<p>The term escalation refers to the action whereby the contact information and situation details are sent on to another employee for resolution.</p>
<h2>Customer Escalation Policy</h2>
<p>When a customer requests to escalate an issue (complaint, problem, grievance, etc.) above the head of the General Manager and speak with the company owner, the General Manager will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provide the Regional Manager's email address to the customer to express their concerns via email.</li>
  <li>Relay to the customer that the Regional Manager will be notified of the situation.</li>
  <li><strong>Will not promise</strong> <strong>any action</strong> such as the Regional Manager responding via email or visiting the customer's property.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Company Escalation Policy: Employees</h2>
<p>If there is a company accountability issue with any other employee, including ones higher up the company chain:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First go to the employee directly and try to resolve the issue.</li>
  <li>If the issue is not resolved satisfactorily, bring the issue to the attention of your manager for resolution.</li>
</ol>
