<h2><strong>Material List Procedure:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>All Material Lists</strong> (other than a few miscellaneous items needed when a job runs short) must only be sent to the Material Manager by the Sales Representative, Office Manager or the General Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Send all material lists to: <a href="mailto:sales@ravnecsupply.com">sales@ravnecsupply.com</a></li>
  <li>Project Coordinators cannot request full job orders.</li>
  <li>Warehouse workers cannot fill orders without orders being entered into inventory software.</li>
  <li>All Material Lists must have a "Deliver by" date and also a "Job start date".</li>
  <li>Distribution must have at least 3 full business days to deliver each job. (see example below)<ul>
      <li>Deliver 1/2, 1/3, or 1/4. Job Install Date: 1/53</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Distribution will deliver all orders falling under these criteria within the delivery zip code list for each branch. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d5-pDWjkf3q6HTH59RYzHVR0UmLsKV1nFa1jDU8cJpM/edit?usp=sharing">Zip Code Zones Spreadsheet</a>
    <ol>
      <li>Orders outside of these zip codes will default to having the crew pick-up at the shop. These will be staged by the "deliver by" date to the branch (Will Call).</li>
      <li><strong>All branch Will Call orders must be submitted with a 24 hours' notice.</strong></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>These criteria apply to both staged jobs (full orders and components) and to delivered jobs.</li>
  <li>All requests made outside of these criteria MUST be requested to and approved via email by Materials Manager.</li>
  <li>Materials Manager will have until E.O.B the day following the request to reply to the request.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>:<ul>
      <li>Jobs that are "thrown in" at the last moment can be filled for <strong>Will Call</strong> pick-up providing the following criteria are met:<ol>
          <li>Order has been sent by OM or GM to Material Manager and ample time is provided for order entry and picking order.</li>
          <li><strong>All branch Will Call orders must be submitted with a 24 hours notice.</strong></li>
          <li>The volume of these requests must be kept to a minimum as determined by the Material Manager: <a href="mailto:delivery@cenvarroofing.com">sales@ravnecsupply.com</a>.</li>
          <li>In the General Manager's absence (vacation), the acting General Manager may send the Material List.</li>
          <li>Any and all requests outside of these criteria may be requested via email to the Material Manager.</li>
          <li>It is up to the discretion of the Material Manager whether or not to accommodate requests based on current workload and efficiency considerations. See the below examples.</li>
