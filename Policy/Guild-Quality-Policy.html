<p><strong>GuildQuality is our third-party customer satisfaction surveying company. They capture feedback from out customers, good, bad, or ugly, and share it with us.</strong></p>
<p>Each branch is required to have an average GuildQuality score of 97% and above.</p>
<p>If a General Manager reviews a branch crossover GuildQuality, they will forward it to the appropriate branch GM for their review.</p>
<p>Note: GuildQuality changed their metrics from a 1 through 4 scale to a 1 through 5 scale. We adjusted our metrics to match.</p>
<p>If you have any GuildQuality questions or concerns, please contact Corporate.</p>
