<h2>Subcontractor Payment Information</h2>
<p>We will pay our subcontractors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$60.00 for skylights</li>
  <li>$65.00 for crickets</li>
  <li>$3.00 per linear foot for counterflashing</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon completion of the PC checklist at the end of each job, Project Coordinators are to take a photo of the billing portion of the checklist and text it to the subcontractor foreman. If the sub foreman finds an error on the billing, the PC is to investigate and correct the error on the spot.</p>
<p>If the subcontractor believes he was shorted on money after he has been paid, he will call Juan who will report it to the Regional Manager. Upon investigation, if there is validity to the assertion, the General Manager will be written up. There shall be one free write up per quarter. Any additional write ups for that quarter will result in the General Manager being fined $200.00 per occurrence.</p>
<p>Each subcontractor will also be instructed to report to Juan each time they are held up for any reason on the job, or if they have had to stop production for any reason that is not our fault (e.g., waiting on material, next job not ready, etc.) Juan will alert the Regional Manager of the complaint, which will prompt an investigation into the issue. The accountability system shall be the same as for wrong pay, the Regional Manager will investigate the report, and if it is true, the General Manager will be written up, one free write up per quarter and fines thereafter per occurrence.</p>
<p>We need to do a better job taking care of our subs and making sure they want to work for us. There have been many complaints regarding both of these problems, and we are losing subs as a result. We want subs clamoring to work for us, not getting upset because they are held up or shorted on pay.</p>
