<h2>Use of Company Accounts and Devices</h2>

<h2>Use of Personal Devices for Company Use</h2>
<p>Only in rare circumstances should a personal device be used for Company work when adequate devices have been provided. Any questions regarding the use of personal devices need to be addressed with management.</p>
