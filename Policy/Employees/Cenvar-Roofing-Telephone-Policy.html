<p>If you receive a call that would be serviced by another branch, write down the customer's name and phone number, then transfer the call to the appropriate branch.</p>
<p><strong>When a call comes in, if they haven’t already stated it, ask for the customer’s name and purpose of their call.</strong></p>
<p>If an existing customer calls (they have a CRM file):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you can answer the question, note the CRM file.</li>

<h2>Customer Inquiry Call</h2>
<p>When a potential customer calls, ask the customer if they are in need of a new roof estimate or a repair estimate. The customer may also be looking for information pertaining to gutters or a go-back service. Use <a href="/i/57">Scheduling a Sales Appointment</a> and enter the customer information into Job Progress.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.cenvarroofing.com/i/90">Entering a New Customer</a> is to be used whether the customer is looking for a roof replacement, roof repair, gutters, or go-backs.</p>
<h2>Upset Customer Calls</h2>
<p>Always remain calm, pleasant, and professional.</p>
<p>If a caller is upset, it is company policy to place them on a brief hold and transfer the call immediately to the branch General Manager.</p>
<p>If the General Manager cannot be reached, write down the name and telephone number and ensure the caller that the General Manager will call them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="//wiki.cenvarroofing.com/i/40">Customer Escalation Policy / Employee Escalation Policy / Complaints</a>.</p>
