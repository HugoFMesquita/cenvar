<h2><strong>Vacation Policy</strong></h2>
<p>Salaried employees will get one week’s vacation at the start of the year if their one-year anniversary date falls in 2024 and two weeks of vacation at the start of the year if their two-year anniversary date falls in 2024. All new employees coming on board will get a prorated amount of 1 week based on their start date below:</p>
<p>Jan 1st through March 30th receives 5 days.</p>
<p>April 1st through June 30th receives 4 days.</p>
<p>July 1st through September 30th receives 2 days.</p>
<p>October 1st through December 31st receive 1 day.</p>
<p>GM’s put in for vacation with the Regional Manager. Branch employees put in for vacation with their GM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Number of vacation days</h3>
<p>This policy does not override pre-negotiated vacation time in the event that time is greater than what is given above.</p>
<p>Vacation days are based on the employee's hire anniversary date, <strong>not calendar date</strong>, and follow the above prorated schedule.</p>
<p>After two years, each employee will get 10 days paid vacation. After eight years, each employee will get 15 days paid vacation. After 15 years, each employee will get 20 days paid vacation.</p>
<p>After two years, five days must be taken between Dec. 1 and March 31, the other vacation days may be taken anytime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Notice for vacation request</h3>
<p>There must be a one week notice for taking 3 days or less vacation.</p>
<p>There must be a four week notice for taking 4 or more days of vacation.</p>
<p>Vacations scheduled 6 months out are granted based upon seniority.</p>
<p>Vacations scheduled less than 6 months out are granted on a first come first serve basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>General requirements</h3>
<p>General Managers may, at any time, limit the number of employees requesting vacation during a specific duration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional unpaid vacation may be taken only with the approval of the General Manager.</p>
<p>Vacation days are not allowed to be taken in 1/2-day increments. A salaried employee may formally request to take up to 3 hours of time which will not count towards vacation. Anything over 3 hours requires the use of 1 full vacation day.</p>
<p>Salaried employees are allowed use of flex (make-up) time up to 4 hours to tend to personal obligations. 4 hours and less may be made up with formal approval from their General Manager. The time must be made up in the same workweek, either before or after the approved time off.</p>
<p>Vacation days are a "use it or lose it" policy and are not carried over to the following year.</p>
<p>In the event of a lay off or terminated position, employee vacation time will follow the <a href="//wiki.cenvarroofing.com/i/49">Severance Policy.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Absences/Sick days</strong></h2>
<p>5 unpaid personal days / absences are allowed per year. An unpaid personal day is any absence with no paper documentation for the absence.</p>
<p>All paid vacation must be used up before any unpaid vacation may be taken.</p>
<p>Excused absences are absences that have court papers, a doctor’s note, or any other paper documentation that the GM accepts at his sole discretion.</p>
<p>All absences, including, but not limited to, leave for the birth or adoption of a child, placement of foster child, planned medical procedure or any other FMLA related leave (see <a href="https://wiki.cenvarroofing.com/en/Company/HR/Cenvar-Roofing-Employee-Handbook">Employee Handbook</a>), require a minimum of 30 days' notice to the employee's manager. If a 30 day notice is not possible, the employee must notify their manager as soon as possible. This does not include sick days.</p>
<p>When taking a sick day, employees are required to text the GM, at least one hour before work starts to let them know they are sick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the employee has no more personal days to use for his sick day, he is required to get a doctor’s note. Failure to do so will be cause for termination.</p>
<p>Any employee who fails to follow our attendance policy is subject to immediate termination. A manager may, at his discretion, elect to keep the employee, in which case he will be written up.</p>
<p>The year shall be a standard Calendar year January 1st thru December 31st.</p>
<p>Cenvar Roofing requires every employee who is injured on the job and is released for “light duty” to report for work and to work a 40-hour work week. We have positions available for anyone cleared by the doctor to work in any capacity.</p>
<p>Late policy is left up to the discretion of the GM.</p>
