<p>A <strong>reclaimed job </strong>is any job that is converted to a sale/contract that was previously either:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Archived and flagged as ‘Job Lost’, or</li>
  <li>In the Future Work (Quoted) bucket with an expired or non-existent follow-up reminder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lost Jobs shall be contacted by the Customer Service Representative (CSR) according to <a href="/i/161">Customer Service Follow Up Calls</a>.</p>
<p>Jobs from the Future Work (Quoted) bucket in Job Progress that have an expired or non-existent follow-up reminder can be contacted by any member of the Call Center team.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>When a potential reclaimed job is found, the appropriate Call Center team member should:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a follow up reminder for themselves (max 30 days).</li>
  <li>Contact the customer.</li>
  <li>Include a note in JP about the contact.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>If a message is left, then indicate a voicemail was left, then set a new reminder.</li>
  <li>If the customer is no longer in need of service, include a note in JP and archive the job.</li>
  <li>If the customer requests a later contact date, include a note in JP, then set a new reminder (30 days max, unless otherwise specified by the customer).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Incentive</h2>
<p>Any successfully reclaimed job shall pay commission:</p>
<ul>
  <li>75% to the Call Center team member</li>
  <li>25% to the original Sales Representative</li>
</ul>
<p>If the original Sales Representative is no longer employed with Cenvar, the Sales Manager shall assign a new Sales Representative. Commission is then adjusted to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>50% to the Call Center team member</li>
  <li>50% to the new Sales Representative</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
