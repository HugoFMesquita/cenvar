<h2>Forklift Certification is required for:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All Cenvar Roofing &nbsp;Project Coordinators</li>
  <li>Members of the Repair Crew</li>
  <li>Shop Crew</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process for Forklift Certification</h2>
<p>The Cenvar Roofing Human Resources (HR) Department will create a forklift training username/password for each new employee during orientation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Note: HR will provide each new employee a password sheet with all Cenvar Roofing logins during the onboarding process.</li>
</ul>
<p>HR will create a unique username/password for the new employee to sign into <a href="http://www.certifyme.net/">www.certifyme.net</a>&nbsp;to take the Forklift Certification.</p>
<p>HR will keep a log of certification dates and will notify the branch General Manager of all employees that have expiring certificates.</p>
<p>The branch General Manager will make arrangements for the employee to retake the test in their branch office.</p>
<p>The unique username/password can be used to recertify when it expires. Forklift certifications expire every 3 years. The employee can log in from any computer as long as they have their unique username/password that was created during onboarding.</p>
