    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HR will create a unique username/password for the new employee to sign into &nbsp;<a href="http://www.certifyme.net/">www.certifyme.net</a>&nbsp;to take the Forklift Certification.</li>
  <li>HR will keep a log of certification dates and will notify the branch General Manager of all employees that have expiring certificates.</li>
  <li>The branch General Manager will make arrangements for the employee to retake the test in their branch office.</li>
  <li>The unique username/password can be used to recertify when it expires. Forklift certifications expire every 3 years. The employee can log in from any computer as long as they have their unique username/password that was created during onboarding.</li>
