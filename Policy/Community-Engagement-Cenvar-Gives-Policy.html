<h2>A percentage of each of our branch's annual profit is allocated to fund local charitable initiatives. We believe it is important to be actively involved in the communities we live in.</h2>
<p>General Managers must spend 10% of their branch marketing budget on the “Engaged Neighbors” part of our business by giving back to the community. The funds do not have to go towards roof giveaways, but can be used for any reason that the GM thinks would be best used to display our “engagement” within their communities.</p>
<p>All branch team members are encouraged to suggest community outreach Cenvar Gives roofing project ideas all year long to their General Manager for project vetting (PCs, Sales, Repairs, OMs, etc.).</p>
<p>General Managers will send each Gives project including dollar amount to the Marketing Manager for final approval.</p>
<p>General Managers will be allowed to spend their branch allocated Cenvar Gives budget for projects within one calendar year (4 quarters). During the first quarter of the following calendar year, whatever Gives funds are left over, will be used for projects allocated by the Cenvar Culture Committee (CCC).</p>
