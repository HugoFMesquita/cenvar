<p>All skylights are to be measured.</p>
<p>All skylights are to be on a separate material list.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unless getting full material and procurement through Ravnec Roofing Supply.</li>
  <li>If ordering full distribution through Ravnec, all skylights will be on one job material list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sales representatives will order all skylights at the time of signature except for models C06 and FCM 2246.</p>
<p>Sales Representatives are required to list the actual skylight part number that they want ordered for each job and are not allowed to list generic skylight dimensions.</p>
<p>Cenvar is required to provide accurate and complete Velux skylight and flashing kit numbers to Ravnec on every material list. If Ravnec has to follow up with Cenver to obtain complete Velux skylight or flashing kit item numbers, Cenvar will incur a $15 charge.</p>
<p>Special order skylights must be accompanied by a written quote from the vendor for distribution to reference.</p>
<p>Office Managers must make sure all skylights are in stock before hard scheduling the job.</p>
<p>Individually ordered skylights for a specific job are required to be shipped to Ravnec, not to the individual branch.</p>
