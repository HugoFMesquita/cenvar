<p>It is the policy of Cenvar Roofing to reimburse staff for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred during pre-authorized work-related travel.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The word “per diem” means “per day” or “for each day." Per diem is a daily allowance for hotel and meal expenses while in travel status that includes an overnight stay.</li>
  <li>Per diem is not given for same-day travel.</li>
  <li>In the event that both the Cenvar Roofing Regional Manager and General Manager deem it necessary for an employee to relocate temporarily to another branch for work related reasons, Cenvar Roofing will provide $100.00 for every night per employee that is spent in that branch.</li>
  <li>Cenvar Roofing allowable per diem of $100.00 covers the cost of overnight hotel stay, meals, and tips.<ul>
      <li>$100.00 includes both hotel and meals per diem.</li>
      <li>If the employee chooses to stay in a more expensive hotel, they will be responsible for all additional charges that incurred over the $100.00 per diem.</li>
      <li>Example: If the “Main Street Hilton” costs $130.00/night, the employee will be responsible for any amount incurred over the allowable per diem. However, if the Sheraton costs $50.00/night, the employee will still receive the daily amount of $100.00 per diem.</li>
      <li>If a crew chooses to share one room and split the cost, each employee is still eligible to receive $100.00 per diem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>$100.00 per diem is tallied per night spent, not per day.</li>
  <li>All per diem must be pre-approved, in advance by both the Regional Manager and General Manager.</li>
  <li>Per diem will be charged to the receiving branch, unless otherwise agreed upon by both the Regional Manager and General Manager.</li>
  <li>Per diem will be paid in the next scheduled payroll. Please send this info to Kimberly Martin at k.martin@cenvarroofing.com.</li>
  <li>This per diem structure is intended for short term stays (no more than one week). All stays longer than 7 nights must be renegotiated and approved by the Regional Manager.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All per diem must be approved by both the Regional Manager and General Manager.</strong></p>
