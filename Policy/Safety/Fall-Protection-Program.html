<h1><i><strong>Purpose</strong></i></h1>
<p>Cenvar is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment and to protecting&nbsp;employees by reducing the risk of injury or fatality when working at heights six (6) feet or more above ground level. Cenvar believes that falls can be prevented by proper planning, providing the right fall protection equipment, and training all workers to use the equipment safely.</p>
<h1><i><strong>Scope</strong></i></h1>
<p>This Fall Prevention Program applies to all Cenvar employees and contractors.&nbsp; All employees and contractors are required to follow the minimum procedures outlined in this program. Any deviations from this program must be immediately brought to the attention of the Program Administrator.<br><br>If work is being estimated or preplanning is taking place at heights <u>prior</u> to <u>any</u> work being started then the Fall Protection requirements of this document do not apply. Example: A salesman is providing a customer with an estimate. Salesmen are required to adhere to all Ladder related policies and OSHA standards at all times.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Program Responsibilities</strong></i></h1>
<p><strong>Management:&nbsp;</strong>Cenvar is responsible for providing the tools, training, and resources necessary to implement this program and for ensuring that the provisions in this program are being followed by the Program Administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Program Administrator:</strong> The Program Administrator is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring each department or functional area has a copy of the program.</li>
  <li>Scheduling employee training and ensuring new hires are properly trained on the program.</li>
  <li>Identifying and providing the necessary personal fall protection methods, or equipment for working in fall hazard situations. Contractors are required to obtain their own fall protection equipment.</li>
  <li>Stopping any unsafe work practice that is not in accordance with this program.</li>
  <li>Periodically reviewing the program and updating it as needed to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supervisors.&nbsp;</strong>Supervisors are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring assigned employees and contractors are properly trained on the Fall Prevention Program.</li>
  <li>Fulfilling the role of competent person, as defined by OSHA, or assigning an appropriate person to be the competent person for the crew.</li>
  <li>Identifying and correcting any unsafe acts or conditions immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Employees.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Every&nbsp;Cenvar employee and contractor is responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this program. All employees will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attend assigned training.</li>
  <li>Understand and follow all procedures in this program.</li>
  <li>Wear the appropriate fall protection equipment when directed or required.</li>
  <li>Properly use, care for, and inspect assigned fall protection equipment.</li>
  <li>Identifying and correcting any unsafe acts or conditions immediately.</li>
  <li>Report any unsafe conditions to a supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<h1><i><strong>Procedures&nbsp;</strong></i></h1>
<h3><strong>General</strong></h3>
<p>All employees and subcontractors will be protected from falling when working on a surface that has an unprotected side, edge, etc., six (6) feet or more above an adjacent lower level; when working from aerial lifts or other elevated work platforms; and when working above dangerous equipment.</p>
<p>Fall hazards will be evaluated by the Program Administrator, manager, or on-site competent person to determine the best method to protect the employee. When selecting what type of fall protection to use, employees and contractors will consider the hierarchy of hazard control, which organizes risk control techniques from most to least effective (examples are show below in order of decreasing effectiveness and preference).</p>

<h3><strong>Fall Hazard Evaluation</strong></h3>
<p>The onsite Cenvar employee will assess each assigned job site for potential fall hazards. This person is typically a Project Coordinator and Fall Protection Competent Person. The evaluation will include steps for protecting employees and contractors from the identified fall hazards. If a contractor starts a job prior to a Cenvar employee arriving on site, it is the contractor’s responsibility to be sure all OSHA standards are followed, including fall protection standards.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Fall Hazards</strong></h3>
<p><u>Leading Edges:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Each worker working on or near a leading&nbsp;edge six (6) feet or more above a lower level will be protected by guardrail systems, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.</p>
<p><u>Low-Slope Roofs:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Workers on a low-slope (less than or equal to 4/12 pitch) roof that has one or more unprotected side or edge shall be protected from falling by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guardrail system.</li>
  <li>Safety net system.</li>
  <li>Personal fall arrest system.</li>
  <li>A combination of conventional fall protection system and warning line system.</li>
  <li>A warning line system and a safety monitoring system. (<i>NOTE: When engaged in roofing work on low-slope roofs 50 feet or less in width, the use of a safety monitoring system without a warning line system is permitted.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Steep Roofs:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Workers on a steep roof (5/12 pitch or greater) that has one or more unprotected side or edge shall be protected from fall by one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guardrail systems with toeboards.</li>
  <li>Safety net systems.</li>
  <li>Personal fall arrest systems (PFAS).</li>
  <li>Rock climbing harnesses shall only be used on roofs with a 9/12 pitch or greater. When rock climbing harnesses are used, the rope/lanyard must be kept taut (no slack).</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Wall Openings:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All wall openings six feet or more above an adjacent surface will be guarded. A rail, picket fence, half door, or equivalent barrier will be placed across the wall opening. If the wall opening extends to the floor, a toe board at least four inches high shall be installed to prevent materials from accidental falling from the edge.</p>
<p>All workers working on, at, above, or near wall openings (including those with chutes attached), where the bottom edge of the wall opening is less than 39 inches above the walking/working surface, must be protected by a guardrail system, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parapet walls must be 39 inches tall, or greater, in order to use them as a wall/guard rail for safety purposes. If the parapet wall is less than 39 inches tall but has an extension fastened to it to raise the height to 39 inches or greater, than Fall Protection is not needed in that area. Any extensions must meet the requirements of a guardrail system in regard to minimal height or force it is able to handle. &nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Floor Openings:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All floor holes two (2) inches in diameter or more will be guarded by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A standard railing with toeboard on all exposed sides</li>
  <li>A covering of sufficient strength and construction to handle the heaviest load that could be placed on it. (<i>Note: While the cover is not in place, the floor hole must be constantly attended by someone or protected by a standard railing.)</i>
    <ul>
      <li>Covering must be marked with “HOLE” so others are aware.</li>
      <li>Covering must be secured so it cannot be accidentally displaced.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><u>Dangerous Equipment or Materials:</u> When working at any height above dangerous equipment or materials, each worker will be protected from falling into or onto the dangerous equipment or materials by a guardrail system, equipment guards, safety net system or personal fall arrest system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Skylights:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Skylights are considered an opening/hole when present on a roof. This includes installed skylights; they are not normally rated to hold the weight of a worker. Others that are rated have been known to fail due to UV and weather exposure over time. A standard guardrail or skylight screens capable of supporting at least 200 pounds must be provided around the opening. If personal fall arrest systems (PFAS) are worn, an additional guardrail or skylight cover is not required. Skylights constructed at least 39 inches above the roof deck with sides capable of supporting 200 pounds do not require additional protection.</p>
<p><u>Aerial Lifts (Articulating lifts) and Self-Powered Work Platforms (Scissor lift):</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Body harnesses must be worn with a lanyard/lifeline, not to exceed 6 feet in length, or a self-retracting lifeline when working from all elevated mobile work platforms. The point of attachment must be the anchor point installed and designated by the equipment manufacturer. Workers will not attach lanyards to lift guardrails or adjacent poles, structures, or equipment while they are working from the aerial lift.&nbsp; Personnel will not move an aerial lift base while the boom is in an elevated working position and the operator is inside the lift platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Scissor lifts</u> and <u>telescoping lifts</u> that can only move vertically do not require the use of a harness and lanyard as long as the work platform is protected by a proper guardrail system. If a <u>forklift personnel platform</u> is used, a full body harness and lifelines are not required as long as the forklift platform have full guard rails (top and mid rails) and toeboards. The platform must be secured to the forklift per manufacturer instructions and the forklift must not be moved (forward/backward) while someone is raised in the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Equipters</u> cannot be used as man lifts. This is strictly forbidden by the manufacturer. There are no attachment points in the Equipter and the sides are not tall enough to meet the criteria of a guardrail system or wall.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Fall Protection Systems&nbsp;</strong></i></h1>
<h3><strong>Guardrail Systems</strong></h3>
<p>After eliminating the elevated work, guardrails are the preferred method for the protection of fall hazards. Typical locations that require guardrails include floor openings, wall openings, open-sided floors, platforms, and runways.</p>
<p>All guardrail systems used&nbsp;by&nbsp;Cenvar will meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Toprail is 42 inches, +/- 3 inches above the walking/working level.</li>
  <li>Midrail is located midway between the top rail and the walking/working level.</li>
  <li>Toprails and midrails will be constructed of materials at least one-quarter inch in thickness or diameter. If wire rope is used for toprails, it must be flagged with a high-visibility material at least every 6 feet and can have no more than 3” of deflection.</li>
  <li>The toprail must be capable of withstanding a force of 200 pounds when applied in any downward or outward direction.</li>
  <li>The midrail must withstand a force of 150 pounds applied in any downward or outward direction.</li>
  <li>Toeboards are required for all guardrails on elevated walking or working platforms where employees working below are exposed to falling objects.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Toeboards must be 4 inches in height and must be securely fastened.</li>
  <li>All rails and toeboards will be smooth to prevent punctures, lacerations, or snagging of clothing.</li>
  <li>The ends of the top rail should not overhang the terminal posts, except when such overhang does not present a projection hazard.</li>
  <li>When a hoisting area is needed, a chain, gate, or removable guardrail section must be placed across the access opening when hoisting operations are not taking place.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS)</strong></h3>
<p>If a fall occurs, the employee must not be able to freefall more than six (6) feet, contact a lower level, or contact dangerous equipment. Careful consideration must be given to the way that a fall arrest system is selected and set up and adjusted so that a 6-foot fall distance is not exceeded. You should always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations when connecting harnesses, lanyards, or retractable (SRLs) so that deceleration distance and elongation are accounted for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total fall distance is the total distance of a free fall, plus the additional distance encountered during deceleration. When calculating total fall distance for a worker who is working at height, all of the following factors must be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Length of lanyard/Self-retracting lifeline:</u> The actual measured length of the lanyard or retractable device that the worker uses to connect their harness to an anchorage point.</li>
  <li><u>Deceleration/Free fall distance:</u> OSHA’s maximum allowable deceleration distance is 3.5 feet which accounts for dynamic elongation of the energy absorber.</li>
  <li><u>Height of worker:</u> The worker’s height is another critical factor that must be accounted for to consider the total fall distance.</li>
  <li><u>Distance from the worker’s feet to the harness D-Ring:</u> Accounts for how much the harness will stretch when supporting the worker.</li>
  <li><u>Safety factor:</u> Allow for an additional safety factor of 3 feet (1 m) below a fallen worker’s feet.</li>
