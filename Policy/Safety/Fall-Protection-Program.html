<h1><i><strong>Purpose</strong></i></h1>
<p>Cenvar is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment and to protecting&nbsp;employees by reducing the risk of injury or fatality when working at heights six (6) feet or more above ground level. Cenvar believes that falls can be prevented by proper planning, providing the right fall protection equipment, and training all workers to use the equipment safely.</p>
<h1><i><strong>Scope</strong></i></h1>
<p>This Fall Prevention Program applies to all Cenvar employees and contractors.&nbsp; All employees and contractors are required to follow the minimum procedures outlined in this program. Any deviations from this program must be immediately brought to the attention of the Program Administrator.<br><br>If work is being estimated or preplanning is taking place at heights <u>prior</u> to <u>any</u> work being started then the Fall Protection requirements of this document do not apply. Example: A salesman is providing a customer with an estimate. Salesmen are required to adhere to all Ladder related policies and OSHA standards at all times.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Program Responsibilities</strong></i></h1>
<p><strong>Management:&nbsp;</strong>Cenvar is responsible for providing the tools, training, and resources necessary to implement this program and for ensuring that the provisions in this program are being followed by the Program Administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Program Administrator:</strong> The Program Administrator is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring each department or functional area has a copy of the program.</li>
  <li>Scheduling employee training and ensuring new hires are properly trained on the program.</li>
  <li>Identifying and providing the necessary personal fall protection methods, or equipment for working in fall hazard situations. Contractors are required to obtain their own fall protection equipment.</li>
  <li>Stopping any unsafe work practice that is not in accordance with this program.</li>
  <li>Periodically reviewing the program and updating it as needed to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supervisors.&nbsp;</strong>Supervisors are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring assigned employees and contractors are properly trained on the Fall Prevention Program.</li>
  <li>Fulfilling the role of competent person, as defined by OSHA, or assigning an appropriate person to be the competent person for the crew.</li>
  <li>Identifying and correcting any unsafe acts or conditions immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Employees.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Every&nbsp;Cenvar employee and contractor is responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this program. All employees will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attend assigned training.</li>
  <li>Understand and follow all procedures in this program.</li>
  <li>Wear the appropriate fall protection equipment when directed or required.</li>
  <li>Properly use, care for, and inspect assigned fall protection equipment.</li>
  <li>Identifying and correcting any unsafe acts or conditions immediately.</li>
  <li>Report any unsafe conditions to a supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<h1><i><strong>Procedures&nbsp;</strong></i></h1>
<h3><strong>General</strong></h3>
<p>All employees and subcontractors will be protected from falling when working on a surface that has an unprotected side, edge, etc., six (6) feet or more above an adjacent lower level; when working from aerial lifts or other elevated work platforms; and when working above dangerous equipment.</p>
<p>Fall hazards will be evaluated by the Program Administrator, manager, or on-site competent person to determine the best method to protect the employee. When selecting what type of fall protection to use, employees and contractors will consider the hierarchy of hazard control, which organizes risk control techniques from most to least effective (examples are show below in order of decreasing effectiveness and preference).</p>

<h3><strong>Fall Hazard Evaluation</strong></h3>
<p>The onsite Cenvar employee will assess each assigned job site for potential fall hazards. This person is typically a Project Coordinator and Fall Protection Competent Person. The evaluation will include steps for protecting employees and contractors from the identified fall hazards. If a contractor starts a job prior to a Cenvar employee arriving on site, it is the contractor’s responsibility to be sure all OSHA standards are followed, including fall protection standards.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Fall Hazards</strong></h3>
<p><u>Leading Edges:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Each worker working on or near a leading&nbsp;edge six (6) feet or more above a lower level will be protected by guardrail systems, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.</p>
<p><u>Low-Slope Roofs:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Workers on a low-slope (less than or equal to 4/12 pitch) roof that has one or more unprotected side or edge shall be protected from falling by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guardrail system.</li>
  <li>Safety net system.</li>
  <li>Personal fall arrest system.</li>
  <li>A combination of conventional fall protection system and warning line system.</li>
  <li>A warning line system and a safety monitoring system. (<i>NOTE: When engaged in roofing work on low-slope roofs 50 feet or less in width, the use of a safety monitoring system without a warning line system is permitted.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Steep Roofs:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Workers on a steep roof (5/12 pitch or greater) that has one or more unprotected side or edge shall be protected from fall by one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guardrail systems with toeboards.</li>
  <li>Safety net systems.</li>
  <li>Personal fall arrest systems (PFAS).</li>
  <li>Rock climbing harnesses shall only be used on roofs with a 9/12 pitch or greater. When rock climbing harnesses are used, the rope/lanyard must be kept taut (no slack).</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Wall Openings:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All wall openings six feet or more above an adjacent surface will be guarded. A rail, picket fence, half door, or equivalent barrier will be placed across the wall opening. If the wall opening extends to the floor, a toe board at least four inches high shall be installed to prevent materials from accidental falling from the edge.</p>
<p>All workers working on, at, above, or near wall openings (including those with chutes attached), where the bottom edge of the wall opening is less than 39 inches above the walking/working surface, must be protected by a guardrail system, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parapet walls must be 39 inches tall, or greater, in order to use them as a wall/guard rail for safety purposes. If the parapet wall is less than 39 inches tall but has an extension fastened to it to raise the height to 39 inches or greater, than Fall Protection is not needed in that area. Any extensions must meet the requirements of a guardrail system in regard to minimal height or force it is able to handle. &nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Floor Openings:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All floor holes two (2) inches in diameter or more will be guarded by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A standard railing with toeboard on all exposed sides</li>
  <li>A covering of sufficient strength and construction to handle the heaviest load that could be placed on it. (<i>Note: While the cover is not in place, the floor hole must be constantly attended by someone or protected by a standard railing.)</i>
    <ul>
      <li>Covering must be marked with “HOLE” so others are aware.</li>
      <li>Covering must be secured so it cannot be accidentally displaced.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><u>Dangerous Equipment or Materials:</u> When working at any height above dangerous equipment or materials, each worker will be protected from falling into or onto the dangerous equipment or materials by a guardrail system, equipment guards, safety net system or personal fall arrest system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Skylights:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Skylights are considered an opening/hole when present on a roof. This includes installed skylights; they are not normally rated to hold the weight of a worker. Others that are rated have been known to fail due to UV and weather exposure over time. A standard guardrail or skylight screens capable of supporting at least 200 pounds must be provided around the opening. If personal fall arrest systems (PFAS) are worn, an additional guardrail or skylight cover is not required. Skylights constructed at least 39 inches above the roof deck with sides capable of supporting 200 pounds do not require additional protection.</p>
<p><u>Aerial Lifts (Articulating lifts) and Self-Powered Work Platforms (Scissor lift):</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Body harnesses must be worn with a lanyard/lifeline, not to exceed 6 feet in length, or a self-retracting lifeline when working from all elevated mobile work platforms. The point of attachment must be the anchor point installed and designated by the equipment manufacturer. Workers will not attach lanyards to lift guardrails or adjacent poles, structures, or equipment while they are working from the aerial lift.&nbsp; Personnel will not move an aerial lift base while the boom is in an elevated working position and the operator is inside the lift platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Scissor lifts</u> and <u>telescoping lifts</u> that can only move vertically do not require the use of a harness and lanyard as long as the work platform is protected by a proper guardrail system. If a <u>forklift personnel platform</u> is used, a full body harness and lifelines are not required as long as the forklift platform have full guard rails (top and mid rails) and toeboards. The platform must be secured to the forklift per manufacturer instructions and the forklift must not be moved (forward/backward) while someone is raised in the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Equipters</u> cannot be used as man lifts. This is strictly forbidden by the manufacturer. There are no attachment points in the Equipter and the sides are not tall enough to meet the criteria of a guardrail system or wall.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Fall Protection Systems&nbsp;</strong></i></h1>
<h3><strong>Guardrail Systems</strong></h3>
<p>After eliminating the elevated work, guardrails are the preferred method for the protection of fall hazards. Typical locations that require guardrails include floor openings, wall openings, open-sided floors, platforms, and runways.</p>
<p>All guardrail systems used&nbsp;by&nbsp;Cenvar will meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Toprail is 42 inches, +/- 3 inches above the walking/working level.</li>
  <li>Midrail is located midway between the top rail and the walking/working level.</li>
  <li>Toprails and midrails will be constructed of materials at least one-quarter inch in thickness or diameter. If wire rope is used for toprails, it must be flagged with a high-visibility material at least every 6 feet and can have no more than 3” of deflection.</li>
  <li>The toprail must be capable of withstanding a force of 200 pounds when applied in any downward or outward direction.</li>
  <li>The midrail must withstand a force of 150 pounds applied in any downward or outward direction.</li>
  <li>Toeboards are required for all guardrails on elevated walking or working platforms where employees working below are exposed to falling objects.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Toeboards must be 4 inches in height and must be securely fastened.</li>
  <li>All rails and toeboards will be smooth to prevent punctures, lacerations, or snagging of clothing.</li>
  <li>The ends of the top rail should not overhang the terminal posts, except when such overhang does not present a projection hazard.</li>
  <li>When a hoisting area is needed, a chain, gate, or removable guardrail section must be placed across the access opening when hoisting operations are not taking place.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS)</strong></h3>
<p>If a fall occurs, the employee must not be able to freefall more than six (6) feet, contact a lower level, or contact dangerous equipment. Careful consideration must be given to the way that a fall arrest system is selected and set up and adjusted so that a 6-foot fall distance is not exceeded. You should always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations when connecting harnesses, lanyards, or retractable (SRLs) so that deceleration distance and elongation are accounted for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total fall distance is the total distance of a free fall, plus the additional distance encountered during deceleration. When calculating total fall distance for a worker who is working at height, all of the following factors must be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Length of lanyard/Self-retracting lifeline:</u> The actual measured length of the lanyard or retractable device that the worker uses to connect their harness to an anchorage point.</li>
  <li><u>Deceleration/Free fall distance:</u> OSHA’s maximum allowable deceleration distance is 3.5 feet which accounts for dynamic elongation of the energy absorber.</li>
  <li><u>Height of worker:</u> The worker’s height is another critical factor that must be accounted for to consider the total fall distance.</li>
  <li><u>Distance from the worker’s feet to the harness D-Ring:</u> Accounts for how much the harness will stretch when supporting the worker.</li>
  <li><u>Safety factor:</u> Allow for an additional safety factor of 3 feet (1 m) below a fallen worker’s feet.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="/safety-graphics/anchorage.png"></figure>
<p>All personal fall arrest system components that are subjected to an impact load must be removed from service immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal fall arrest systems will be inspected prior to each use, and damaged or deteriorated components removed from service and destroyed. Removed components can be used for training purposes by the program administrator or another Cenvar authorized Fall Protection trainer in lieu of being destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three main components to a personal fall arrest system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anchorage point</li>
  <li>Body harness</li>
  <li>Connecting devices</li>
</ul>
<p>All personal fall arrest system components must meet the requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z359 Standards. Meeting the ANSI standards makes components OSHA compliant. Components meeting the European standard EN 795 may or may not meet the ANSI Z359 standards so unless the components meet both standards, only components meeting the ANSI standards may be used. Some online stores, including Amazon, will sell harnesses or components that meet just the EN standards. Anything bought in a store in the United States should be completely ANSI compliant but check the descriptions and/or packaging to be sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Anchorages:</u> Secure anchor points are the most critical component when employees must use fall arrest equipment. All anchor points will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sound and capable of withstanding a 5000 lb. per worker attached and independent of any anchorage used to support or suspend platforms.</li>
  <li>Easily accessible by workers to avoid fall hazards during hook-up.</li>
  <li>Free of sharp edges that could reduce breaking strength when tying off. Chafing pads or abrasion-resistant straps must be used on any sharp-edged structures to prevent cutting of safety lanyards or lifelines.</li>
  <li>At the worker’s shoulder level or higher to limit freefall to 6 feet or less and prevent contact with any lower level (except when using a self-retracting lifeline or 3-foot lanyard).</li>
  <li>Fastened to the structure (through the sheathing to structure underneath) using nails or screws able to withstand the forces required by the anchor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Cross Arm Straps (CAS) can be used. CAS are wrapped around a structure and then a fall lanyard is connected to it. CAS must be able to withstand the possible fall forces including the requirements listed in this section. If multiple CAS are used, no more than two (2) CAS shall be wrapped around the same truss or rafter. CAS are designed to be used by only one (1) worker.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Guardrails and hoists cannot be used as anchorage points.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Body Harness</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>A full body harness is required.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The use of body belts is prohibited.</li>
  <li>The only attachment point allowed on the body harness is the center (Dorsal) D-ring on the harness back unless the harness is designed with a D-ring attachment point on the front (pre-sternal/waist) position. This is usually integrated into the harness on the waist belt. If attached to the front, the worker must not be able to free fall greater than two (2) feet.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The back D-ring needs to be positioned at shoulder level – center of back (Horizontally). The D-ring height on the back should not be lower than shoulder height.</li>
  <li>Fall protection equipment shall never be load tested.</li>
  <li>All body harnesses must be OSHA compliant and/or meet ANSI/ASSP Z359 standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Connecting Devices</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Allowable devices include rope or web lanyards, rope grabs, or retractable lifelines.</li>
  <li>All snap hooks must be self-locking and double action.</li>
  <li>Horizontal lifelines will be designed by a qualified person and installed in accordance with the design requirements.</li>
  <li>Lanyards and vertical lifelines must have a minimum breaking strength of 5,000 pounds.</li>
  <li>The use of steel lanyards is prohibited.</li>
  <li>A lanyard may not be clipped back to itself (e.g. snap hook is wrapped around a structure and then clipped back onto the lanyard) unless specifically designed to do so – most are not designed for this. If not designed for such configuration, the lanyard’s strength can be reduced up to 70%!</li>
  <li>If vertical lifelines/lanyards are used, each employee must be attached to a separate lifeline.</li>
  <li>Lifelines must be protected against cuts and abrasion.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Warning Lines</strong></h3>
<p>Warning line systems and work in controlled access zones (CAZs) will be developed, based on the task, in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2). The warning line system shall consist of ropes, wires, or chains, and supporting stanchions.</p>
<p>The warning line system shall:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be erected not less than 6 feet (1.8 m) from the roof edge (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(1) (i)); not less than 10 feet when mechanical equipment is used (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(1)(ii)).<ul>
      <li>The 6/10 foot rule includes “holes” in the roof surface (greater than 2 inches) such as roof hatches, skylights, vent holes, etc. unless they are protected by proper guardrails, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be flagged at least every 6 feet with high visibility material (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(i)).</li>
  <li>Be no less than 34 inches (.9 m) and no more than 39 inches (1.0 m) from the walking/working surface (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(ii)).</li>
  <li>Be capable of resisting a force of at least 16 pounds (71 N) horizontally without tipping over (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(iii)).</li>
  <li>Have a minimum tensile strength of 500 pounds (2.22 kN) (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(iv)).</li>
  <li>Be attached in such a way that pulling on the line will not result in slack being taken up in adjacent sections before the stanchion tips over (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(v)).</li>
  <li>Control lines will extend the entire length of the unprotected or leading edge and be approximately parallel to the unprotected or leading edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workers using a warning line shall not be allowed in the area between the roof edge and the warning line unless the employee is performing roofing work in the area. If performing roofing work, a safety monitor or fall restraint/arrest system should be used. A fall restraint system is preferred as it keeps the worker from being able to fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points of access, material handling areas, storage areas, and hoisting areas shall be connected to the work area by an access path formed by two warning lines. When the point of access is not in use, a warning line shall be placed across the path near the work area, or the path may be offset so that a person cannot walk directly into the work area.</p>

</figure>
<h3><strong>Safety Monitors</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Shall be competent to recognize fall hazards.</li>
  <li>Shall warn employees of fall hazards.</li>
  <li>Shall be on the same walking/working surface and within visual distance of the employees being monitored.</li>
  <li>Shall be close enough to communicate orally with every employee.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Not by radio, phone, etc. No loud tools/machinery are allowed between the SM and the workers.</li>
  <li>Shall not have other responsibilities.&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Cannot be helping do the work. Cannot be distracted by anything.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Roof Sections must be less than 50 feet in width in order to use a safety monitor without warning lines.<ul>
      <li>Larger roofs can be broken into sections.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Workers must only be working in one section at a time unless there are multiple safety monitors. One for each section.</li>
  <li>Safety Monitors should be used sparingly. There is greater risk of a fall and higher chance of OSHA Compliance Officer stopping to inspect if a compliance officer does not see other fall protection systems being used, especially if there are no warning lines present.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If warning lines are present, the roof width can be over 50 feet when using a safety monitor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Safety Monitors should wear a different color or unique hi-visibility safety vest/shirt from the other workers so the monitor is distinguishable from the workers. This is not an OSHA requirement but is highly encouraged to make it easy to spot a safety monitor (for the workers and for OSHA). &nbsp;</li>
  <li>To determine if the width of a roof section is less than 50 feet, reference the proper way to measure the roof structure according to OSHA standard. See the following snips from:<ul>
      <li>29 CFR 1926 Subpart M App A - Determining Roof Widths - Non-Mandatory Guidelines for Complying With 1926.501(B)(10). Overhead views of roof sections.&nbsp;</li>
