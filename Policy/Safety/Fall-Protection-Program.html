<h1><i><strong>Purpose</strong></i></h1>
<p>Cenvar is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment and to protecting&nbsp;employees by reducing the risk of injury or fatality when working at heights six (6) feet or more above ground level. Cenvar believes that falls can be prevented by proper planning, providing the right fall protection equipment, and training all workers to use the equipment safely.</p>
<h1><i><strong>Scope</strong></i></h1>
<p>This Fall Prevention Program applies to all Cenvar employees and contractors.&nbsp;All employees and contractors are required to follow the minimum procedures outlined in this program. Any deviations from this program must be immediately brought to the attention of the Program Administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fall Protection requirements do not apply when estimating or preplanning work at heights <u>before</u> work begins. For example, salespeople providing estimates must follow all ladder safety policies and OSHA standards at all times but are not required to use Fall Protection as their exposure is limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a customer, or potential customer, requests Cenvar employees and contractors to use Fall Protection, we will honor that request. For example, a potential commercial/industrial roofing customer requires anyone on their roof to be protected by a Fall Restraint or Fall Arrest system, we will be connected. &nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Program Responsibilities</strong></i></h1>
<p><strong>Management:&nbsp;</strong>Cenvar is responsible for providing the tools, training, and resources necessary to implement this program and for ensuring that the provisions in this program are being followed by the Program Administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Program Administrator:</strong> The Program Administrator is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring each department or functional area has a copy of the program.</li>
  <li>Scheduling employee training and ensuring new hires are properly trained on the program.</li>
  <li>Identifying and providing the necessary personal fall protection methods, or equipment for working in fall hazard situations. Contractors are required to obtain their own fall protection equipment.</li>
  <li>Stopping any unsafe work practice that is not in accordance with this program.</li>
  <li>Periodically reviewing the program and updating it as needed to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supervisors.&nbsp;</strong>Supervisors are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring assigned employees and contractors are properly trained on the Fall Prevention Program.</li>
  <li>Fulfilling the role of competent person, as defined by OSHA, or assigning an appropriate person to be the competent person for the crew.</li>
  <li>Identifying and correcting any unsafe acts or conditions immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Employees.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Every&nbsp;Cenvar employee and contractor is responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this program. All employees will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attend assigned training.</li>
  <li>Understand and follow all procedures in this program.</li>
  <li>Wear the appropriate fall protection equipment when directed or required.</li>
  <li>Properly use, care for, and inspect assigned fall protection equipment.</li>
  <li>Identifying and correcting any unsafe acts or conditions immediately.</li>
  <li>Report any unsafe conditions to a supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<h1><i><strong>Procedures&nbsp;</strong></i></h1>
<h3><strong>General</strong></h3>
<p>All employees and subcontractors will be protected from falling when working on a surface that has an unprotected side, edge, etc., six (6) feet or more above an adjacent lower level; when working from aerial lifts or other elevated work platforms; and when working above dangerous equipment.</p>
<p>Fall hazards will be evaluated by the Program Administrator, manager, or on-site competent person to determine the best method to protect the employee. When selecting what type of fall protection to use, employees and contractors will consider the hierarchy of hazard control, which organizes risk control techniques from most to least effective (examples are show below in order of decreasing effectiveness and preference).</p>

<h3><strong>Fall Hazard Evaluation</strong></h3>
<p>The onsite Cenvar employee will assess each assigned job site for potential fall hazards. This person is typically a Project Coordinator and Fall Protection Competent Person. The evaluation will include steps for protecting employees and contractors from the identified fall hazards. If a contractor starts a job prior to a Cenvar employee arriving on site, it is the contractor’s responsibility to be sure all OSHA standards are followed, including fall protection standards.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Fall Hazards</strong></h3>
<p><u>Leading Edges:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Each worker working on or near a leading&nbsp;edge six (6) feet or more above a lower level will be protected by guardrail systems, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.</p>
<p><u>Low-Slope Roofs:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Workers on a low-slope (less than or equal to 4/12 pitch) roof that has one or more unprotected side or edge shall be protected from falling by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guardrail system.</li>
  <li>Safety net system.</li>
  <li>Personal fall arrest system.</li>
  <li>A combination of conventional fall protection system and warning line system.</li>
  <li>A warning line system and a safety monitoring system. (<i>NOTE: When engaged in roofing work on low-slope roofs 50 feet or less in width, the use of a safety monitoring system without a warning line system is permitted.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><u>Steep Roofs:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Workers on a steep roof (5/12 pitch or greater) that has one or more unprotected side or edge shall be protected from fall by one of the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guardrail systems with toeboards.</li>
  <li>Safety net systems.</li>
  <li>Personal fall arrest systems (PFAS).</li>
  <li>Rock climbing harnesses shall only be used on roofs with a 9/12 pitch or greater. When rock climbing harnesses are used, the rope/lanyard must be kept taut (no slack).</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Wall Openings:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All wall openings six feet or more above an adjacent surface will be guarded. A rail, picket fence, half door, or equivalent barrier will be placed across the wall opening. If the wall opening extends to the floor, a toe board at least four inches high shall be installed to prevent materials from accidental falling from the edge.</p>
<p>All workers working on, at, above, or near wall openings (including those with chutes attached), where the bottom edge of the wall opening is less than 39 inches above the walking/working surface, must be protected by a guardrail system, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parapet walls must be 39 inches tall, or greater, in order to use them as a wall/guard rail for safety purposes. If the parapet wall is less than 39 inches tall but has an extension fastened to it to raise the height to 39 inches or greater, than Fall Protection is not needed in that area. Any extensions must meet the requirements of a guardrail system in regard to minimal height or force it is able to handle. &nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Floor Openings:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All floor holes two (2) inches in diameter or more will be guarded by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A standard railing with toeboard on all exposed sides</li>
  <li>A covering of sufficient strength and construction to handle the heaviest load that could be placed on it. (<i>Note: While the cover is not in place, the floor hole must be constantly attended by someone or protected by a standard railing.)</i>
    <ul>
      <li>Covering must be marked with “HOLE” so others are aware.</li>
      <li>Covering must be secured so it cannot be accidentally displaced.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><u>Dangerous Equipment or Materials:</u> When working at any height above dangerous equipment or materials, each worker will be protected from falling into or onto the dangerous equipment or materials by a guardrail system, equipment guards, safety net system or personal fall arrest system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Skylights:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Skylights are considered an opening/hole when present on a roof. This includes installed skylights; they are not normally rated to hold the weight of a worker. Others that are rated have been known to fail due to UV and weather exposure over time. A standard guardrail or skylight screens capable of supporting at least 200 pounds must be provided around the opening. If personal fall arrest systems (PFAS) are worn, an additional guardrail or skylight cover is not required. Skylights constructed at least 39 inches above the roof deck with sides capable of supporting 200 pounds do not require additional protection.</p>
<p><u>Aerial Lifts (Articulating lifts) and Self-Powered Work Platforms (Scissor lift):</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Body harnesses must be worn with a lanyard/lifeline, not to exceed 6 feet in length, or a self-retracting lifeline when working from all elevated mobile work platforms. The point of attachment must be the anchor point installed and designated by the equipment manufacturer. Workers will not attach lanyards to lift guardrails or adjacent poles, structures, or equipment while they are working from the aerial lift.&nbsp; Personnel will not move an aerial lift base while the boom is in an elevated working position and the operator is inside the lift platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Scissor lifts</u> and <u>telescoping lifts</u> that can only move vertically do not require the use of a harness and lanyard as long as the work platform is protected by a proper guardrail system. If a <u>forklift personnel platform</u> is used, a full body harness and lifelines are not required as long as the forklift platform have full guard rails (top and mid rails) and toeboards. The platform must be secured to the forklift per manufacturer instructions and the forklift must not be moved (forward/backward) while someone is raised in the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Equipters</u> cannot be used as man lifts. This is strictly forbidden by the manufacturer. There are no attachment points in the Equipter and the sides are not tall enough to meet the criteria of a guardrail system or wall.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Fall Protection Systems&nbsp;</strong></i></h1>
<h3><strong>Guardrail Systems</strong></h3>
<p>After eliminating the elevated work, guardrails are the preferred method for the protection of fall hazards. Typical locations that require guardrails include floor openings, wall openings, open-sided floors, platforms, and runways.</p>
<p>All guardrail systems used&nbsp;by&nbsp;Cenvar will meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Toprail is 42 inches, +/- 3 inches above the walking/working level.</li>
  <li>Midrail is located midway between the top rail and the walking/working level.</li>
  <li>Toprails and midrails will be constructed of materials at least one-quarter inch in thickness or diameter. If wire rope is used for toprails, it must be flagged with a high-visibility material at least every 6 feet and can have no more than 3” of deflection.</li>
  <li>The toprail must be capable of withstanding a force of 200 pounds when applied in any downward or outward direction.</li>
  <li>The midrail must withstand a force of 150 pounds applied in any downward or outward direction.</li>
  <li>Toeboards are required for all guardrails on elevated walking or working platforms where employees working below are exposed to falling objects.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Toeboards must be 4 inches in height and must be securely fastened.</li>
  <li>All rails and toeboards will be smooth to prevent punctures, lacerations, or snagging of clothing.</li>
  <li>The ends of the top rail should not overhang the terminal posts, except when such overhang does not present a projection hazard.</li>
  <li>When a hoisting area is needed, a chain, gate, or removable guardrail section must be placed across the access opening when hoisting operations are not taking place.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS)</strong></h3>
<p>If a fall occurs, the employee must not be able to freefall more than six (6) feet, contact a lower level, or contact dangerous equipment. Careful consideration must be given to the way that a fall arrest system is selected and set up and adjusted so that a 6-foot fall distance is not exceeded. You should always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations when connecting harnesses, lanyards, or retractable (SRLs) so that deceleration distance and elongation are accounted for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total fall distance is the total distance of a free fall, plus the additional distance encountered during deceleration. When calculating total fall distance for a worker who is working at height, all of the following factors must be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Length of lanyard/Self-retracting lifeline:</u> The actual measured length of the lanyard or retractable device that the worker uses to connect their harness to an anchorage point.</li>
  <li><u>Deceleration/Free fall distance:</u> OSHA’s maximum allowable deceleration distance is 3.5 feet which accounts for dynamic elongation of the energy absorber.</li>
  <li><u>Height of worker:</u> The worker’s height is another critical factor that must be accounted for to consider the total fall distance.</li>
  <li><u>Distance from the worker’s feet to the harness D-Ring:</u> Accounts for how much the harness will stretch when supporting the worker.</li>
  <li><u>Safety factor:</u> Allow for an additional safety factor of 3 feet (1 m) below a fallen worker’s feet.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image"><img src="/safety-graphics/anchorage.png"></figure>
<p>All personal fall arrest system components that are subjected to an impact load must be removed from service immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal fall arrest systems will be inspected prior to each use, and damaged or deteriorated components removed from service and destroyed. Removed components can be used for training purposes by the program administrator or another Cenvar authorized Fall Protection trainer in lieu of being destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three main components to a personal fall arrest system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anchorage point</li>
  <li>Body harness</li>
  <li>Connecting devices</li>
</ul>
<p>All personal fall arrest system components must meet the requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z359 Standards. Meeting the ANSI standards makes components OSHA compliant. Components meeting the European standard EN 795 may or may not meet the ANSI Z359 standards so unless the components meet both standards, only components meeting the ANSI standards may be used. Some online stores, including Amazon, will sell harnesses or components that meet just the EN standards. Anything bought in a store in the United States should be completely ANSI compliant but check the descriptions and/or packaging to be sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Anchorages:</u> Secure anchor points are the most critical component when employees must use fall arrest equipment. All anchor points will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sound and capable of withstanding a 5000 lb. per worker attached and independent of any anchorage used to support or suspend platforms.</li>
  <li>Easily accessible by workers to avoid fall hazards during hook-up.</li>
  <li>Free of sharp edges that could reduce breaking strength when tying off. Chafing pads or abrasion-resistant straps must be used on any sharp-edged structures to prevent cutting of safety lanyards or lifelines.</li>
  <li>At the worker’s shoulder level or higher to limit freefall to 6 feet or less and prevent contact with any lower level (except when using a self-retracting lifeline or 3-foot lanyard).</li>
  <li>Fastened to the structure (through the sheathing to structure underneath) using nails or screws able to withstand the forces required by the anchor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Cross Arm Straps (CAS) can be used. CAS are wrapped around a structure and then a fall lanyard is connected to it. CAS must be able to withstand the possible fall forces including the requirements listed in this section. If multiple CAS are used, no more than two (2) CAS shall be wrapped around the same truss or rafter. CAS are designed to be used by only one (1) worker.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Guardrails and hoists cannot be used as anchorage points.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Body Harness</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>A full body harness is required.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The use of body belts is prohibited.</li>
  <li>The only attachment point allowed on the body harness is the center (Dorsal) D-ring on the harness back unless the harness is designed with a D-ring attachment point on the front (pre-sternal/waist) position. This is usually integrated into the harness on the waist belt. If attached to the front, the worker must not be able to free fall greater than two (2) feet.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The back D-ring needs to be positioned at shoulder level – center of back (Horizontally). The D-ring height on the back should not be lower than shoulder height.</li>
  <li>Fall protection equipment shall never be load tested.</li>
  <li>All body harnesses must be OSHA compliant and/or meet ANSI/ASSP Z359 standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Connecting Devices</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Allowable devices include rope or web lanyards, rope grabs, or retractable lifelines.</li>
  <li>All snap hooks must be self-locking and double action.</li>
  <li>Horizontal lifelines will be designed by a qualified person and installed in accordance with the design requirements.</li>
  <li>Lanyards and vertical lifelines must have a minimum breaking strength of 5,000 pounds.</li>
  <li>The use of steel lanyards is prohibited.</li>
  <li>A lanyard may not be clipped back to itself (e.g. snap hook is wrapped around a structure and then clipped back onto the lanyard) unless specifically designed to do so – most are not designed for this. If not designed for such configuration, the lanyard’s strength can be reduced up to 70%!</li>
  <li>If vertical lifelines/lanyards are used, each employee must be attached to a separate lifeline.</li>
  <li>Lifelines must be protected against cuts and abrasion.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Warning Lines</strong></h3>
<p>Warning line systems and work in controlled access zones (CAZs) will be developed, based on the task, in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2). The warning line system shall consist of ropes, wires, or chains, and supporting stanchions.</p>
<p>The warning line system shall:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be erected not less than 6 feet (1.8 m) from the roof edge (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(1) (i)); not less than 10 feet when mechanical equipment is used (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(1)(ii)).<ul>
      <li>The 6/10 foot rule includes “holes” in the roof surface (greater than 2 inches) such as roof hatches, skylights, vent holes, etc. unless they are protected by proper guardrails, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be flagged at least every 6 feet with high visibility material (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(i)).</li>
  <li>Be no less than 34 inches (.9 m) and no more than 39 inches (1.0 m) from the walking/working surface (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(ii)).</li>
  <li>Be capable of resisting a force of at least 16 pounds (71 N) horizontally without tipping over (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(iii)).</li>
  <li>Have a minimum tensile strength of 500 pounds (2.22 kN) (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(iv)).</li>
  <li>Be attached in such a way that pulling on the line will not result in slack being taken up in adjacent sections before the stanchion tips over (29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(v)).</li>
  <li>Control lines will extend the entire length of the unprotected or leading edge and be approximately parallel to the unprotected or leading edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workers using a warning line shall not be allowed in the area between the roof edge and the warning line unless the employee is performing roofing work in the area. If performing roofing work, a safety monitor or fall restraint/arrest system should be used. A fall restraint system is preferred as it keeps the worker from being able to fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Points of access, material handling areas, storage areas, and hoisting areas shall be connected to the work area by an access path formed by two warning lines. When the point of access is not in use, a warning line shall be placed across the path near the work area, or the path may be offset so that a person cannot walk directly into the work area.</p>

</figure>
<h3><strong>Safety Monitors</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Shall be competent to recognize fall hazards.</li>
  <li>Shall warn employees of fall hazards.</li>
  <li>Shall be on the same walking/working surface and within visual distance of the employees being monitored.</li>
  <li>Shall be close enough to communicate orally with every employee.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Not by radio, phone, etc. No loud tools/machinery are allowed between the SM and the workers.</li>
  <li>Shall not have other responsibilities.&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Cannot be helping do the work. Cannot be distracted by anything.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Roof Sections must be less than 50 feet in width in order to use a safety monitor without warning lines.<ul>
      <li>Larger roofs can be broken into sections.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Workers must only be working in one section at a time unless there are multiple safety monitors. One for each section.</li>
  <li>Safety Monitors should be used sparingly. There is greater risk of a fall and higher chance of OSHA Compliance Officer stopping to inspect if a compliance officer does not see other fall protection systems being used, especially if there are no warning lines present.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If warning lines are present, the roof width can be over 50 feet when using a safety monitor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Safety Monitors should wear a different color or unique hi-visibility safety vest/shirt from the other workers so the monitor is distinguishable from the workers. This is not an OSHA requirement but is highly encouraged to make it easy to spot a safety monitor (for the workers and for OSHA). &nbsp;</li>
  <li>To determine if the width of a roof section is less than 50 feet, reference the proper way to measure the roof structure according to OSHA standard. See the following snips from:<ul>
      <li>29 CFR 1926 Subpart M App A - Determining Roof Widths - Non-Mandatory Guidelines for Complying With 1926.501(B)(10). Overhead views of roof sections.&nbsp;</li>

<p>All ladders used&nbsp;by&nbsp;Cenvar employees or contractors will meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rated greater than the weight of the worker and any tools or equipment carried by the worker</li>
  <li>Appropriate ladder style for the job. Stepladders will not be used in a folded position (unless made to be used as such), stepladders will be tall enough to perform work without standing on the top step, extension ladders will extend a minimum of three feet above the edge of the roof or access point, etc.</li>
  <li>Metal/Aluminum ladders will not be used near electrical lines or sources. Wood and Fiberglass ladders can be used in these areas with caution. Avoid these locations with any ladders if possible.</li>
  <li>All safety non-slip feet must be in place, secure and in sound condition.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ladder set up</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Inspection</strong>:</p>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/safety-graphics/ladder.jpg"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>Ladders must be inspected before initial use in each work shift to be sure there are no broken, missing, or defective parts, slick surfaces (oil, mud, etc.), or otherwise unsafe parts on the ladder. The ladder must be cleaned or repaired prior to use.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the ladder is bent or damaged in a way that it cannot be repaired immediately, the ladder must not be used and tagged “Dangerous: Do Not Use” (or similar language) OR destroyed by cutting up ladder rungs.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Appendix A&nbsp;</strong>provides an example of items to be inspected. Appendix A is not required to be used during each inspection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Base:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ladders must be set up on a surface that is firm, level, immovable, and is not slippery or unstable. Ladder leveling feet or accessories may be used to make the ladder base level.</li>
  <li>Ladders that must be placed on a slippery surface or unlevel ground must be secured or stabilized to prevent accidental displacement. All efforts should be made to place the ladder in a different, more level and stable location.</li>
  <li>Ladder shoes/feet should be setup properly. Non-slip shoes should be flat on hard surfaces such as asphalt/pavement, concrete, or flat metal. On dirt, grass, soil, mulch, or other semi-soft surface, the ladder’s shoes should be moved so the spur/spike plates are downward pointed to penetrate the ground.</li>
  <li>Ladders must not be placed on movable objects such as, trailers, vehicles or other unsteady objects.</li>
  <li>Allow sufficient room to step off the ladder safely. Keep the area around the bottom and the top of the ladder clear of equipment, material, and tools. If access is obstructed, secure the top of the ladder to a rigid support.</li>
  <li>When setting up a ladder in a high activity or traffic area, use a barrier (cones, caution tape, etc.) to redirect workers, pedestrians, vehicles, and equipment. If the ladder is placed in front of a door, always block off the door.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The top of extension ladders must be against a solid, fixed surface and extend at least three (3) feet above the roof edge or landing surface if the ladder is used to access the roof or upper landing.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If ladder extensions are installed on the top of the ladder, the ladder itself can be placed at the roof or upper landing edge in a manner that allows the extensions to extend a minimum of three (3) feet above the roof edge or upper landing. The extension must be secured to the ladder as directed by the ladder rail extension manufacturer.</li>
  <li>Extension ladders will be set up using the 4-to-1 principle (base of the ladder placed at a distance from the wall that is equal to one fourth of the height that the ladder is extended, which is approximately a 75-degree angle.</li>
  <li>When ladders are used to access the roof or an upper landing at heights of 18 feet or higher, either a second person must steady the ladder base while a worker is on the ladder or the top of the ladder must be effectively tied off to a sound anchor point. This is not required if a worker is simply working from the ladder. 18-20 feet is the roof edge height of a typical two-story residential home. When in doubt, tie it off.</li>
  <li>Ladder standoffs, stabilizers, or gutter protectors must be used unless such use would be considered unsafe or impractical due to the ladder setup location or the location of the work being completed. This is done to enhance safety and protection the gutter/eve from damage (e.g. denting)</li>
  <li>Standoffs and gutter guards/protectors by themselves are not to be considered as a tie off since there is nothing securing the ladder to the roof and/or the gutter. However, if the ladder is secured to a gutter guard (and the gutters are secured firmly to the building) then that can be considered a proper ladder securing method.</li>
  <li>Home/Job made ladder standoffs or guards as long as they meet the following criteria;<ul>
      <li>Must provide a stable surface so the ladder cannot move side-to-side.</li>
      <li>Must protect property (gutter, flashing, etc.) from being damaged or scratched.</li>
      <li>Must be secure enough to not fold up or suddenly move closer to the surface it is in contact with. For example, a 1x6 board cannot be simply set on a gutter to be used as a standoff. If the 1x6 (or other lumber) is secured to the roof and the ladder is tied off, then it could function as a standoff.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ladders may be set up on the rake edge of the roof. Property (drip edge, etc.) must be protected from denting and scratching where the ladder makes contact.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Multi-way / multi-position specialty ladders (e.g. Little Giant) may be used to access roofs or upper landings if they can support the weight required and can reach three feet above the roof edge or upper landing while at the proper angle. Often, specialty ladders are not long enough, or suited, for this type of use. Some multi ladder like Little Giant make stabilizers specifically for their ladders. Regular stabilizers will not work on Little Giant ladders. Some ladder gutter guards/protectors will work with Little Giant ladders.</li>
  <li>When setting up a step ladder, the spreaders must be extended and locked. The step ladder shall never be sued in the closed/folded position unless the ladder is specifically designed for this use (e.g. Werner’s LEANSAFE ladders)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ladder use</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain a 3-point contact (two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand) when climbing or descending a ladder.</li>
  <li>Always face the ladder when climbing up or descending.</li>
  <li>Keep the body inside the side rails.</li>
  <li>Use extra care when getting on or off the ladder at the top or bottom. Avoid tipping the ladder over sideways or causing the ladder base to slide out.</li>
  <li>Do not make sudden movements while on the ladder.</li>
  <li>Do not overreach while working from a ladder.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Never move, “hop”, or “walk” a ladder while still on the ladder.</li>
  <li>Unless the ladder is designed for such use, only one worker can be on a ladder at a time.</li>
  <li>Never use a ladder in a manner it was not designed for.</li>
</ul>

<h1><i><strong>Scaffolds</strong></i></h1>
<p>Scaffolds are complex systems with multiple connection points, subject to a number of factors that could affect their stability and reliability.&nbsp;Cenvar will use only a competent person or company who has received specific training to erect scaffolds, except for small portable scaffolds.</p>
<p><strong>Basic requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The working edge of the scaffold will be placed no more than 14 inches from the front of the building or structure.</li>
  <li>Platforms will extend over the end supports by at least 6 inches, and not more than 12 inches, unless cleated or restrained.</li>
  <li>All components that are supplied by the manufacturer will be used unless they are parts specifically designed for optional uses and are not being used at the time.</li>
  <li>All parts, including casters, pipes/poles, rails, toe boards, platforms, cams, locking pins and all connection devices must be inspected and found to be in good condition prior to each use.</li>
  <li>Guardrails are to be placed between 36 and 45 inches high and placed at the open ends and sides of the platform, and must be able to withstand a force of 200 pounds. Midrails will be placed halfway between the toprail and the toeboard. Toeboards must be in place where employees working below are exposed to falling objects.</li>
  <li>Cross bracing and railings should not be used as a means of climbing to or accessing the platform. Workers will only use the installed ladders or stairs.</li>
  <li>For mobile scaffolds, the caster wheels must be locked and all locking pins in place prior to use.</li>
  <li>Fall protection systems are required when employees erect and disassemble scaffolding.</li>
  <li>Hard hats or safety helmets are to be worn at all times while working on or around scaffolding.</li>
</ul>
<h1><i><strong>Personal Fall Arrest System Inspection</strong></i></h1>
<p>Employees must visually inspect their entire personal fall arrest system prior to every use (<i><strong>Appendix B&nbsp;</strong>provides an example of items to be inspected. Appendix B is not required to be used during each inspection</i>). The inspection will follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. Any damaged components must be removed from service immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Webbing:</strong> The entire surface of webbing must be inspected for damage. Beginning at one end, bend the webbing in an inverted “U.” Holding the body side of the belt toward you, grasp the belt with your hands six to eight inches apart. This surface tension makes the damaged fibers or cuts easier to see. Watch for frayed edges, broken fibers, pulled stitches, cuts, burns and chemical damage. Check the tongue for loose, distorted or broken grommets. The webbing cannot have any additional punched holes.</p>
<p><strong>D-Rings/Back Pads:</strong> D-rings will be checked for distortion, cracks, breaks, and rough or sharp edges. The D-ring should pivot freely. D-ring back pads should also be inspected for damage.</p>
<p><strong>Buckles:</strong> Buckles will be inspected to identify any unusual wear, frayed or cut fibers or distortion. Buckle tongues must be free of distortion in shape and motion. They should overlap the buckle frame and move freely back and forth in their socket. The roller should turn freely on the frame. Friction and mating buckles must be inspected to ensure the outer bars and center bars are straight. Pay special attention to corners and attachment points of the center bar.</p>
<p><strong>Snaps:</strong> Must be inspected closely for hook-and-eye distortions, cracks, corrosion, or pitted surfaces. The keeper (latch) should seat into the nose without binding and should not be distorted or obstructed. The keeper spring should exert sufficient force to firmly close the keeper. Keeper locks must prevent the keeper from opening when the keeper closes.</p>
<p><strong>Thimbles:</strong> The thimble must be firmly seated in the eye of the splice, and splice should have no loose or cut strands. The edges of the thimble must be free of sharp edges, distortion or cracks.</p>
<p><strong>Web Lanyard:</strong> Inspect the lanyard by bending the webbing over a curved surface, such as a pipe, observing each side of the webbed lanyard for any cuts or breaks. Examine the webbing for swelling, discoloration, cracks or burns. Check closely for any breaks in the stitching.</p>
<p><strong>Rope Lanyard:</strong> Rotate the rope lanyard while inspecting from end to end.&nbsp; This will make any fuzzy, worn, broken or cut fibers more apparent. The rope diameter should be uniform throughout, following a short break-in period. Weakened areas from extreme loads will appear as a noticeable change from the original diameter. Make sure the rope has no knots tied in it. Knots can reduce the strength of the rope by up to 60 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Shock-Absorbing Lanyard:</strong> Shock-absorbing lanyards should be examined similarly to a web lanyard. However, also look for signs of deployment. If the lanyard shows signs of having been put under load (e.g. torn out stitching), remove it from service.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Self-Retracting Lanyard/Lifeline:</strong> The lanyard housing must be inspected to ensure that casing bolts are tight and that there are no loose fasteners, missing parts, cracks or excessive wear, or corrosion.&nbsp; Webbing must be inspected for cuts, nicks, or tears as well as for any broken fibers, stitching, or fraying. Steel lanyards will be inspected for cuts, fraying, broken wires, overall deterioration, and excessive wear. Check fittings for wear or cracks and obvious damage.&nbsp; Employees will follow manufacturer’s recommendations for additional inspection tasks.</p>
<h1><i><strong>Rescue</strong></i></h1>
<p>Personnel requiring the use of personal fall protection equipment will use a “Buddy System” or have an observer to render assistance when and if required. Prior to performing the work, a means of rescue in the event of a fall must be immediately available if employees cannot be expected to rescue themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All components of fall arrest system impacted by a fall event shall be removed from service. The components will be tagged with employee’s name, date, and activity at time of fall and give the equipment to the Program Administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Appendix C&nbsp;</strong>provides an optional Rescue plan form. OSHA does not require a written rescue plan; however, each jobsite must have a plan to rescue should one be needed.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Self-Rescue</strong></h3>
<p>Persons working at heights may be able to perform a self-rescue by climbing back up to the level from which they fell, typically a few inches to 3 feet.&nbsp; Employees who fall any distance should return to the floor or ground to be medically evaluated.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Assisted Rescue</strong></h3>
<p>Persons unable to self-rescue will be assisted, if appropriate, by their "buddy" or other observer. The "buddy" will obtain the approved rescue and descent device and secure it to an anchor rated for at least 3,000 pounds. They will attach the haul line to the worker’s fall arrest system using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attaching&nbsp;the line directly to a D-ring on the worker’s harness.</li>
  <li>Using a rescue pole for attaching the line.</li>
  <li>Attaching a rescue grab to the lanyard or vertical lifeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "buddy" will raise or lower the fallen worker to the appropriate work platform or ground and provide any needed medical aid.</p>
<p>Other workers on the roof may work together to pull the fallen worker back up to the roof as another option.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Assisted Rescue with Aerial Lift</strong></h3>
<p>Aerial lifts can also be used to assist a fallen employee to safety.&nbsp; The lift can be maneuvered underneath the fallen worker.&nbsp;A second lanyard or self-retracting lifeline will be attached in the aerial lift to the fallen worker.&nbsp; Disconnect the rescued worker from the impacted fall arrest equipment. Lower the worker to the ground and provide any needed medical aid.</p>
<h1><i><strong>Employee and Supervisor Training</strong></i></h1>
<p>Each employee who may be exposed to fall hazards must be trained to recognize the hazards and the procedures to follow to minimize the hazards. Training will consist of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fall hazards in the work area.</li>
  <li>Correct procedures for erecting, using, maintaining, disassembling, and inspecting the fall prevention and protection systems.</li>
  <li>Selection, proper use and care of equipment of a personal fall arrest system.</li>
  <li>Limitations of fall protection equipment.</li>
  <li>Role of employees in fall protection plans.</li>
  <li>Rescue procedures to follow in case of a fall.</li>
  <li>Overview of the OSHA fall protection requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supervisors must review the Fall Prevention Program with their employees at the following times:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upon initial development of the plan.</li>
  <li>Whenever the employee's responsibilities or designated actions under the plan change.</li>
  <li>Whenever changes are made to the plan.</li>
  <li>Whenever there is a change in the type of fall protection equipment used.</li>
  <li>Whenever a new employee is hired or assigned.</li>
  <li>Whenever a known hazard is added to the work environment.</li>
  <li>Whenever a fall protection procedure fails.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Contractors</strong></i></h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each contractor who is retained to perform operations that require fall protection will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Obtain all information regarding Cenvar identified fall hazards and required protective measures.</li>
  <li>Coordinate fall protection with Cenvar Program Administrator, General Manager, or Projector Coordinator as needed.</li>
  <li>Provide Cenvar Program Administrator with a copy of their Fall Protection Program (if they have one).</li>
  <li>If the contractor does not have a fall protection program or has received inadequate fall protection training, Cenvar will provide the contractor with fall protection training to ensure the contractor is aware of workplace hazards and proper use of fall protection systems.</li>
  <li>Follow all OSHA standards, especially those for Fall Protection as it is the cause of the greatest number of construction-related deaths and OSHA citations.</li>
  <li>Follow any other requirements set forth in the Cenvar “Subcontractor Agreement.”</li>
</ul>
<h1><i><strong>Inclement Weather</strong></i></h1>
<p>Weather can make work more hazardous and steps need to be taken to protect workers that are working in inclement weather.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>High Winds</u>: </strong>While OSHA does not set a maximum windspeed for working at heights, employers do have a responsibility to protect against known hazards (OSHA’s General Duty Clause).<br><br>OSHA Definition of High Winds:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wind of such velocity that one or more of the following hazards would be present:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wind could blow an employee from an elevated location.</li>
  <li>The wind could cause an employee or equipment handling material to lose control of the material.</li>
  <li>The wind could cause an employee or equipment handling material to lose control of the material.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) normally considers winds exceeding 64.4 kilometers per hour (<strong>40 miles per hour</strong>), or 48.3 kilometers per hour (<strong>30 miles per hour</strong>) if the work involves material handling, as meeting this criteria, unless the employer takes precautions to protect employees from the hazardous effects of the wind.</p>
<p>Efforts should be made to NOT start a job (or continue one) if winds are going to be very high that day. Any employee or contractor foreman can make the determination that winds are too high to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aerial lift operations during high winds:</strong> See the aerial lift’s manufacturer’s manual to see what the wind rating and safe use limits are for that lift. These limits set by the aerial lift manufacturer shall be followed.</p>
<p><strong><u>Lightning</u>: </strong>Employers, supervisors, and workers should understand lightning risks, characteristics, and precautions to minimize workplace hazards. Lightning is unpredictable and can strike outside the heaviest rainfall areas or even up to <strong>10 miles</strong> from any rainfall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If lightning is visible or if workers hear thunder, workers should seek shelter inside buildings. If no buildings or suitable structures are available, workers should seek shelter inside vehicles with the windows raised. In either case, workers should remain inside until 30 minutes after hearing the last sound of thunder. See OSHA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3863.pdf">Lightening Fact Sheet</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong><u>Rain / Precipitation</u>: </strong>Though OSHA regulations or standards for working in the rain do not exist. OSHA’s General Duty Clause requires employers to provide a safe workplace, free from recognized hazards.</p>
<p>Rain can increase workplace hazards and make tasks more challenging to execute. Besides obstructing vision, rain can cause surfaces to be slippery, leading to falls and injuries, even at ground level.&nbsp;<br><br>Employees and contractors should not work during sustained rain. Work should NOT be started if rain is suspected, unless it is a passing shower and work can resume after the rain stops, or can be completed before the rain begins.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Refresher Training</strong></i></h1>
<p>Refresher training will be conducted to ensure that all employees and contractors have the knowledge and skills needed safely use fall protection systems. Refresher training will be conducted for individuals when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The employee or contractor is observed improperly using fall protection systems.</li>
  <li>The employee or contractor has been involved in a fall protection related accident.</li>
  <li>The employee or contractor is using a different or new type of fall protection system.</li>
  <li>The program administrator identifies a need to conduct refresher training.</li>
</ul>
<h1><i><strong>Violations</strong></i></h1>
<p>Employees or contractors found to be violating this policy, especially regarding the safety practices, will face written reprimand and/or their employment terminated.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><i><strong>Record Retention</strong></i></h1>
<p>Cenvar will maintain Fall Prevention Program training records for&nbsp;five (5) years. All program records will be kept by the Program Administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<h1><i><strong>Revision History</strong></i></h1>
<p>Policy enacted February 7, 2025.</p>
<h1><i><strong>Distribution</strong></i></h1>
<p>Once revisions are complete, any updates to this policy will be distributed to all affected employees via email and/or Google chat. The most updated policy revision shall be posted at each branch. The policy must be posted in a conspicuous manner, so it is visible to all employees. This policy will also be posted on the Cenvar wiki site for easy employee access.</p>
<h1><i><strong>Definitions</strong></i></h1>
<p><strong>Anchorage</strong>: a secure point of attachment for lifelines, lanyards, or deceleration devices.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Body belt (safety belt)</strong>: a strap with means both for securing it about the waist and for attaching it to a lanyard, lifeline, or deceleration device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Since January 1, 1998, OSHA has prohibited the use of a body belt as part of a personal fall arrest system. Exception: When used correctly, body belts are recognized by OSHA as an acceptable fall protection component when used as a part of 1) a restraining device that prevents a fall or 2) a positioning device that limits a free fall to 2 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Body harness</strong>: straps that may be secured about the worker in a manner that will distribute the fall arrest forces over at least the thighs, pelvis, waist, chest, and shoulders, with means for attaching it to other components of a personal fall arrest system.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Buckle</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>any device for holding the body belt or body harness closed around the worker’s body.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Competent person</strong>: one who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings or working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to workers, and who has authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Connector</strong>: a device that is used to couple (connect) parts of the personal fall arrest system and positioning device systems together. It may be an independent component of the system, such as a carabineer, or it may be an integral component of part of the system (such as a buckle or D-ring sewn into a body belt or body harness, or a snaphook spliced or sewn to a lanyard or self-retracting lanyard).<br><br><strong>Controlled access zone (CAZ)</strong>: an area in which certain work (for example, overhand bricklaying) may take place without the use of guardrail systems, personal fall arrest systems, or safety net systems; and where access to the zone is controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous equipment</strong>: means equipment, such as vats, tanks, electrical equipment, machinery, equipment or machinery with protruding parts, or other similar units, that, because of their function or form, may harm an employee who falls into or onto the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Deceleration device</strong>: any mechanism (such as a rope grab, rip-stitch lanyard, specially-woven lanyard, tearing or deforming lanyards, automatic self-retracting lifelines/lanyards, etc.) which serves to dissipate a substantial amount of energy during a fall arrest, or otherwise limit the energy imposed on a worker during fall arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Deceleration distance</strong>: the additional vertical distance a falling employee travels, excluding lifeline elongation and free fall distance, before stopping, from the point at which the deceleration device begins to operate. It is measured as the distance between the location of a worker’s body belt or body harness attachment point at the moment of activation (at the onset of fall arrest forces) of the deceleration device during a fall, and the location of that attachment point after the worker comes to a full stop.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Equivalent</strong>: alternative designs, materials, or methods to protect against a hazard, which the employer can demonstrate will provide an equal or greater degree of safety for workers than the methods, materials, or designs specified in the standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong>: load refusal, breakage, or separation of component parts. Load refusal is the point where the ultimate strength is exceeded.<br><br><strong>Fall hazard</strong>: A fall hazard is anything at your worksite that could cause you to lose your balance or lose bodily support and result in a fall. Any walking or working surface can be a potential fall hazard. Any time you are working at a height of four feet or more, you are at risk. OSHA requires that fall protection be provided at six feet in construction. However, regardless of the fall distance, fall protection must be provided when working over dangerous equipment and machinery.</p>
<p><strong>Fall protection</strong>: any equipment, device, or system that prevents an employee from falling from an elevation or mitigates the effect of such a fall.<br><br><strong>Free fall</strong>: the act of falling before a personal fall arrest system begins to apply force to arrest the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Grab bar:</strong> an individual horizontal or vertical handhold installed to provide access above the height of the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>Guardrail system</strong>: a barrier erected along an unprotected or exposed side, edge, or other area of a walking-working surface to prevent employees from falling to a lower level.</p>
<p><strong>Hole</strong>:&nbsp;means a gap or open space in a floor, roof, horizontal walking-working surface, or similar surface that is at least 2 inches (5 cm) in its least dimension.</p>
<p><strong>High Wind</strong>: A wind of such velocity that one or more of the following hazards would be present:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wind could blow an employee from an elevated location.</li>
  <li>The wind could cause an employee or equipment handling material to lose control of the material.</li>
  <li>The wind would expose an employee to other hazards not controlled by the standard involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: OSHA normally considers winds exceeding 40 miles per hour, or 30 miles per hour if the work involves material handling, as meeting this criterion, unless the employer takes precautions to protect employees from the hazardous effects of the wind.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Load</strong>: the force exerted on a worker's body during a fall when it is arrested by a fall protection system, essentially the peak force experienced at the moment of impact when a fall is stopped by a harness and lanyard, measured in pounds or Newtons.</p>
<p><strong>Infeasible</strong>: impossible to perform the construction work using a conventional fall protection system (that is, guardrail system, safety net system, or personal fall arrest system); or technologically impossible to use any one of these systems to provide fall protection.</p>
<p><strong>Leading edge</strong>: the edge of a floor, roof, or formwork for a floor or other walking or working surface (such as the deck) which changes location as additional floor, roof, decking, or formwork sections are placed, formed, or constructed. A leading edge is considered to be an “unprotected side and edge” during periods when it is not actively and continuously under construction.<br><br><strong>Ladder</strong>: means a device with rungs, steps, or cleats used to gain access to a different elevation.</p>
<p><strong>Lanyard</strong>: a flexible line of rope, wire rope, or strap that generally has a connector at each end for connecting the body belt or body harness to a deceleration device, lifeline, or anchorage.</p>
<p><strong>Lifeline</strong>: a component consisting of a flexible line for connection to an anchorage at one end to hang vertically (vertical lifeline), or for connection to anchorages at both ends to stretch horizontally (horizontal lifeline), and which serves as a means for connecting other components of a personal fall arrest system to the anchorage.</p>
<p><strong>Low-slope roof (OSHA):</strong> a roof that has a slope less than or equal to a ratio of 4 in 12 (vertical to horizontal).</p>
<p><strong>Lower level:</strong> a surface or area to which an employee could fall. Such surfaces or areas include, but are not limited to, ground levels, floors, roofs, ramps, runways, excavations, pits, tanks, materials, water, equipment, and similar surfaces and structures, or portions thereof.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum intended load</strong>: the total load (weight and force) of all employees, equipment, vehicles, tools, materials, and other loads the employer reasonably anticipates to be applied to a walking-working surface at any one time.<br><br><strong>Mechanical equipment</strong>: all motor- or human-propelled wheeled equipment used for roofing work, except wheelbarrows and mop carts.</p>
<p><strong>Opening:</strong> a gap or open space in a wall, partition, vertical walking-working surface, or similar surface that is at least 30 inches (76 cm) high and at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide, through which an employee can fall to a lower level.</p>
<p><strong>Personal fall arrest system (PFAS)</strong>: a system used to arrest an employee in a fall from a walking-working surface. It consists of a body harness, anchorage, and connector. The means of connection may include a lanyard, deceleration device, lifeline, or a suitable combination of these.</p>
<p><strong>Personal fall protection system</strong>: a system (including all components) an employer uses to provide protection from falling or to safely arrest an employee's fall if one occurs. Examples of personal fall protection systems include personal fall arrest systems, positioning systems, and travel restraint systems.</p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong>: a walking-working surface that is elevated above the surrounding area.</p>
<p><strong>Portable ladder</strong>: a ladder that can readily be moved or carried, and usually consists of side rails joined at intervals by steps, rungs, or cleats.</p>
<p><strong>Positioning device system</strong>: a body belt or body harness system rigged to allow a worker to be supported on an elevated vertical surface, such as a wall, and work with both hands free while leaning.</p>
<p><strong>Qualified person</strong>: describes a person who, by possession of a recognized degree, certificate, or professional standing, or who by extensive knowledge, training, and experience has successfully demonstrated the ability to solve or resolve problems relating to the subject matter, the work, or the project.</p>
<p><strong>Rope grab</strong>: a deceleration device which travels on a lifeline and automatically, by friction, engages the lifeline and locks so as to arrest the fall of a worker. A rope grab usually employs the principles of inertial locking, cam/level locking, or both.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Roof</strong>: the exterior surface on the top of a building. This does not include floors or formwork, which, because a building has not been completed, temporarily become the top surface of a building.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Roofing work</strong>: the hoisting, storage, application, and removal of roofing materials and equipment, including related insulation, sheet metal, and vapor barrier work, but not including the construction of the roof deck.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Safety-monitoring system</strong>: a safety system in which a competent person is responsible for recognizing and warning workers of fall hazards.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Self-retracting lifeline/lanyard</strong>: a deceleration device containing a drum-wound line which can be slowly extracted from, or retracted onto, the drum under slight tension during normal worker movement, and which, after onset of a fall, automatically locks the drum and arrests the fall.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Snaphook</strong>: a connector comprised of a hook-shaped member with a normally closed keeper, or similar arrangement, which may be opened to permit the hook to receive an object and, when released, automatically closes to retain the object. Snap hooks are generally one of two types:(1) The locking type with a self-closing, self-locking keeper which remains closed and locked until unlocked and pressed open for connection or disconnection; or (2) The non-locking type with a self-closing keeper which remains closed until pressed open for connection or disconnection. As of January 1, 1998, the use of a non-locking snaphook as part of personal fall arrest systems and positioning device systems is prohibited.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steep roof (OSHA)</strong>: a roof having a slope <u>greater</u> than 4 in 12 (vertical to horizontal).&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Toeboard</strong>: a low protective barrier that will prevent the fall of materials and equipment to lower levels and provide workers protection from falls.<br><br><strong>Rung</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>step</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>cleat:</strong> means the cross-piece of a ladder on which an employee steps to climb up and down.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffold:&nbsp;</strong>any temporary elevated or suspended platform and its supporting structure, including anchorage points, used to support employees, equipment, materials, and other items.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stepladder</strong>: a self-supporting, portable ladder that has a fixed height, flat steps, and a hinged back.</p>
<p><strong>Unprotected sides and edges:</strong> any side or edge of a walking-working surface (except at entrances and other points of access) where there is no wall, guardrail system, or stair rail system to protect an employee from falling to a lower level.</p>
<p><strong>Warning line</strong>: means a barrier erected to warn employees that they are approaching an unprotected side or edge, and which designates an area in which work may take place without the use of other means of fall protection. Warning lines typically consist of pennant flags, flagging, or caution/danger tape.</p>
<p><strong>Work area</strong>: that portion of a walking or working surface where job duties are being performed.&nbsp;</p>
