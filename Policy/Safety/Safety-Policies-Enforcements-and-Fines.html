<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZeZZ34GNKcLJFyXsfY3MvBpTom5s0XNVggRGZGZ9ERI/edit">Cenvar Roofing Safety Requirements document</a> is signed and acknowledged by every employee during the employee onboarding process. This document is a detailed list of safety requirements that must be abided by.</p>
<h2>Employee Cenvar Roofing Safety Requirements Doc</h2>
<h3>Section A:</h3>
<p>OSHA approved safety harnesses must be worn by every employee on an active reroof job. They must be attached to an OSHA approved rope to a properly installed OSHA approved anchor point. Rock climbing harnesses may be used on a 9/12 pitch or more. When using a rock climbing harness, the rope MUST stay taught.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rock climbing harnesses are not considered a fall arrest system, but a fall restraint system. Note: per OSHA and ANSI Z359, never use a body belt in a fall arrest application. Body belts are acceptable for fall restraint only.</li>
  <li>Harnesses must be properly cinched and adjusted.</li>
  <li>Safety ropes must be properly adjusted at all times so that they will arrest a fall.</li>
  <li>No more than two employees may attach to one 10k lb. anchor point at any time. Make sure the anchors that are being used are rated for at least 5,000 lbs. per anchor per person. Manufacturer instructions must be followed on securing the anchor to the roof.</li>
  <li>Only one man is allowed to go up to mount the first anchor. He must mount the first anchor immediately upon getting on the roof, tie himself off immediately to set the rest of the anchors, and then attach additional ropes to allow the other employees to get on the roof.</li>
  <li>Anchors must be installed every 15-20' along the ridge line.</li>
  <li>When getting onto the roof, every employee must attach and adjust his rope before getting off the ladder onto the roof.</li>
  <li>Every employee must get completely onto the ladder with both feet before detaching from his rope when getting off the roof.</li>
  <li>When finishing a job, only one employee may remain on the roof to take out the last anchor and finish the last section.</li>
  <li>Hard hats must be worn while working on the ground within 30' of a building if there is any construction, construction preparation, or if any person or material is on the roof.</li>
  <li>Ladders shall be set every 20 feet at the eaves to make dismounting the roof safer.</li>
  <li>All ladders must be tied off to an anchor point for the duration of the job.</li>
  <li>The first man up, and the last man off the roof, must have a helper hold the bottom of the ladder because it's not tied off yet.</li>
  <li>Ladders, when set up on hard surfaces, must have two bundles of shingles on feet to prevent kick out.</li>
  <li>When carrying tools or material up the ladder, they must be handed from the ladder to the roof, to an employee already in a harness. Recommend: Must have three-point contact at all times when ascending and descending a ladder.</li>
  <li>Safety glasses must be worn at all times while operating a nail gun or power saw.</li>
  <li>All safety violations carry escalating fines, and finally termination! See the Team Guide for specifics.</li>
