<p>Customers should never use our equipment or be asked to go on the roof by employees. This policy is not intended to keep a customer off their own roof but to ensure the safety of everyone and protect us from increased liability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a customer wishes to go on their roof while Cenvar employees/subcontractors are present, the following policy and procedure apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, ask the customer if we can provide photos or videos of the area (or items) they want to see in order to avoid them going on the roof. This is the preferred procedure, and many customers will be fine with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the customer insists on going on the roof, the customer will be advised the following.</p>
<h6>1. The customer must use their own ladder to access the roof.</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Cenvar/subcontractor equipment (ladders, Equiptor, etc.) cannot be used by the customer to access the roof.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h6>2. Before the customer goes on the roof, Cenvar employees and/or the subcontractor crew will get off the roof.&nbsp;</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Care will be taken to cover any potential holes or hazards prior to the customer getting on the roof. If any hazards are still present, the customer must be told about them.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Customers will be reminded of the fall dangers of being on the roof and the trip hazards of the material and equipment on the roof.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h6>3. Once the customer comes off the roof, the employees/subcontractor can continue work.&nbsp;</h6>
<p>This policy applies to all Cenvar employees and subcontractors.&nbsp;</p>
