<p><strong>Cenvar Roofing is happy to come out to investigate any leak and we will provide a thorough report on the cause of the leak.</strong></p>
<h2>At-fault determination</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the leak is deemed to be a failure on Cenvar Roofing's part, we will gladly make all necessary repairs.</li>
  <li>If the leak is deemed to be caused by anything other than the roof replacement, we will charge a $250.00 service fee to diagnose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, the customer will receive a report of the cause of the leak, provided by Cenvar Roofing.</p>
