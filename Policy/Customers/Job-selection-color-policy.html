<p>Customers must agree to the job color selection by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Signing the contract with the color selection specified, or</li>
  <li>Signing the color selection form sent through Job Progress</li>
</ul>
<p>If the customer signs the contract with no color selection, they must complete the color selection form sent via Job Progress once they select a color.</p>
<p>The customer's job must not be hard scheduled if neither the color selection form or the contract have been signed by the customer.</p>
<p>Office Managers are responsible to verify that the customer has signed and agreed to the color selection via the contract or the color selection form prior to hard scheduling.</p>
