Changes to a Cenvar Solar system are the responsibility of the Sales Representative, including verifying the change order and obtaining the customer's signature for the change.

The Master Electrician should be consulted, as needed, to verify the change order is acceptable.

Sales should make a note in the CRM that a change is pending / has happened. If needed, an email with additional information should be emailed to operations@cenvarsolar.com.

Only after all changes have been verified, accepted, and signed off should the the job go to Operations to begin installation.
