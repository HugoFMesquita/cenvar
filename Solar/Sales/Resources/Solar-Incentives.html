<p>The Residential Clean Energy credit equals of 30% of the costs of a new solar system that is installed from 2022 through 2032. The credit decreases to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034.</p>

<h2>Virginia Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)</h2>
<p>Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) represent the “green” value of your electricity. They are like a voucher that proves your electricity is produced by a renewable energy source, like solar panels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://energy.virginia.gov/renewable-energy/documents/VCEASummary.pdf">Virginia Clean Economy Act</a> establishes a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) that Dominion and AEP produce 100% of their electricity by 2045 &amp; 2050.</p>
<p>Homeowners with solar panels earn 1 SREC for every 1,000 kWh that their solar system produces.</p>
<p>The SREC cannot be sold directly through to the Utility company. They need to be sold through an aggregator, such as <a href="https://www.suntribetrading.com/">Sun Tribe Trading</a>. See Sun Tribe for more information.</p>
<p>The amount each SREC is worth varies. See <a href="https://www.suntribetrading.com/virginia-srec-pricing">Current SREC price</a>.</p>
