## **Peace of Mind Guarantee**

Cenvar Solar guarantees that the System will produce 100% of the estimated annual production for the first (3) years (the “Guaranteed Production”). If it is determined that at the end of each of the first three (3) years, the System has not produced within the guaranteed range, Cenvar Solar will add panels, at its expense, to increase the production of the system to 100% of the Guaranteed Production. If there is not enough space on the roof or property to add panels the company will refund the Customer for the percentage of the total purchase price of the system based on the percentage difference between the Guaranteed Production and the actual kWh electricity produced by the System plus an additional 2%.
