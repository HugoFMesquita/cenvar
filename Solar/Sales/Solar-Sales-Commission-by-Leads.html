<p><strong>Corporate Supplied Leads - 6.5% commission</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A lead that comes through the Lead Center as an appointment from Cenvar's&nbsp;marketing efforts.</li>
  <li>Contacts that are in the Cenvar Database as previous customers.</li>
  <li>Leads that come because of cross selling another Cenvar product.<ul>
      <li>For example, you go to an appointment from a corporate lead for roofing and discuss solar&nbsp;and they purchase both.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Leads obtained at a trade show that is sponsored by Cenvar.</li>
  <li>Referrals from a current Cenvar customer that booked an appointment through the Lead Center.</li>
  <li>Leads referred by an employee of Cenvar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self-Generated Leads â€“ 8% commission</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Door hangers that are left by the Sales Specialist and contact&nbsp;the lead center to set up an&nbsp;appointment.</li>
  <li>Customer referral when the appointment is booked by the Sales Specialist.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Prospects who call a Sales Specialist directly and that are not in the Cenvar database.</li>
