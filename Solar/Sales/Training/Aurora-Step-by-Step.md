**Design Rules:**

Do not place panels in the purple areas with strips. This is the fire set back area. Panels may slightly be placed in this area.

Design the system between 100% - 110% of the customers kilowatt they are currently using with the electric company.

Always start panels in the portrait position.

Under Irradiance place the panels from Bright Yellow to Orange. Avoid the Purple areas unless necessary.

Remove obstructions (trees) to improve the output of the system.
