<h2>Design System</h2>
<ol>

  <li>Click the accept button under the review model</li>
  <li>Click Design request bar<ul>
      <li>Irradiance tab (Image of the Sun)&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Bright Yellow Best – Dark Purple Worst</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Under System tab fire pathways click the auto place fire pathways button.</li>
  <li>System panels&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Modules select REC panels under Solar Panels</li>
      <li>Add Microinverters – IQ8PLUS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select Fill Roof Space or manually place.&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>&nbsp;Once panels are on the roof each panel you can drag and drop into another location on the roof.</li>
      <li><strong>MUST HAVE MINIMUM</strong> 2 panels together. No singular panel arrays or mounting planes.</li>
      <li>The process is repeated for multiple buildings on the property.</li>
      <li>A black colored panel means the placement of the panel is good.</li>
      <li>Yellow colored panel means this placement may or may not work.</li>
      <li>Red colored panel means the placement will not work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Panel Orientation<ul>
      <li>Select Panel</li>
      <li>Select Orientation<ol>

          <li>landscape can placed on top of portrait if can not fit (2) rows portrait</li>
          <li>If system is going to require majority landscape, must seek approval prior to sale (almost 40% additional cost to company on material)</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Design Rules:</strong></p>
<p>Do not place panels in the purple areas with strips. This is the fire set back area. Panels may slightly be placed in this area.</p>
<p>Design the system between 100% - 110% of the customers kilowatt they are currently using with the electric company.</p>
<p>Always start panels in the portrait position.</p>
<p>Under Irradiance place the panels from Bright Yellow to Orange. Avoid the Purple areas unless necessary.</p>
<p>Remove obstructions (trees) to improve the output of the system.</p>
