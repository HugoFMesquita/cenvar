<h2><strong>Lead from Prospect Bacon has Requested an Appointment</strong></h2>
<p>Contact from Prospect Bacon is automatically added to HubSpot as a<strong> Deal</strong> in the <strong>Sales Pipeline</strong> under <strong>Appointment Se</strong>t, assigned to a <strong>Sales Specialist</strong>, and added to the Sales Specialist's Google calendar as an appointment for a 15-minute call or video chat.</p>
<p>Although these leads are going directly to the Appointment Set stage, they should be thought of as new leads. The only difference is that the lead has chosen to set up an appointment directly with you.</p>
<p>The <strong>Lead Source</strong> will say Prospect Bacon</p>
<p>The goal of the 15-minute call or video chat is to collect missing information (see ‘Appointment’ below) and determine if they are a good lead for potentially buying solar and setting up a future appointment.</p>
<h2><strong>Reschedule Appointment (if necessary)</strong></h2>
<p>The Sales Specialist may reschedule the appointment if the time does not work for them through phone call, email, text, or Tara. Tara is an AI tool/chatbot that the lead initially conversed with. Tara is the recommended choice to attempt to reschedule the appointment since this is the way the contact has been communicated up to this point with Prospect Bacon.</p>
<p>How to access and use Tara</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add their calendars: (On the left-hand side) Calendars &gt; Calendar Settings &gt; Connections.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Reach out to Chase in marketing once this is done to confirm it is set up properly.</li>
  <li>(On the left-hand side) click on “Conversations”</li>
  <li>This is where all conversations that Tara is having with potential clients are located.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Next to the search bar, click on “Filters”&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the client IS assigned - under “assigned to” click on your name to only show the potential clients that have booked an appointment&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the client IS NOT assigned - simply search the client’s name in the search bar and you can see the conversation Tara has been having with the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a new appointment is set</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move the deal to the <strong>Call Attempt</strong> stage and then move the deal to the <strong>Appointment Set </strong>stage and complete the information in the drop-down menu to the right (<strong>Appointment date</strong>, <strong>Appointment time</strong>, and <strong>Appointment type). </strong>Click the orange save tab at the bottom. These two steps will allow the new appointment to show up on your google calendar automatically.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Contact No Show for Appointment</strong></h2>
<p>Move the Contact to <strong>DQ</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under <strong>Lost or DQ Reason</strong> drop down select <strong>No Show</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Appointment</strong></h2>
<p>The Sales Specialist attends the appointment through a phone call or video chat.</p>
<p>Ideas for Information to gather or verify from HubSpot on the call to be able to validate them as a good candidate for solar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Verify or gather Physical Address, City, State, Zip.</li>
  <li>Site address where the installation of panels, if it is different from their home address.</li>
  <li>Email Address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Why are they interested in solar?</li>
  <li>Which best describes their interest level?<ul>
      <li>Gathering information</li>
      <li>Looking to get better educated.</li>
      <li>Ready to Purchase</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the approximate age of their roof?</li>
  <li>What type of roof do they have?</li>
  <li>What year was their house built?</li>
  <li>What is your timeframe to add solar?</li>
  <li>On a scale of 1-5 what is their likelihood of adding Solar<ul>
      <li>1 not at all</li>
      <li>5 Yes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ask them to send you their electric bill. They can either:<ul>
      <li>Email it to you.</li>
      <li>Take a picture on their cell phone and email or text you a photo.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Update Hubspot</strong></h2>
<p>Verify that you are the <strong>Deal Owner</strong> and <strong>Sales Rep</strong>. If not add your name to each field.</p>
<p>Add or verify the contact information under the<strong> About this deal</strong> in the left sidebar is correct and completed.</p>
<p>When you add the<strong> Site Address</strong>, copy and paste the address into Google and get the Google map of their house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy the link of the map from Google and paste it into the <strong>Google Map Location</strong> in Hubspot.</p>
<p>Add the Cenvar <strong>Branch location</strong> in the Branch Location field. This is based on their home address and which Cenvar Branch it is within.</p>
<p>If you have their electric bill, upload it under the <strong>Attachments </strong>area on the right sidebar.</p>
<p>After the initial conversation,</p>
<ul>
  <li>If another appointment (virtual or in person) is requested, move the deal to <strong>Call Attempt</strong> stage and then move the deal to <strong>Appointment Set </strong>stage and complete the information in the drop down menu to the right (<strong>appointment date</strong>, <strong>appointment time</strong>, and <strong>appointment type) </strong>and click the orange save tab at the bottom. These two steps will allow the new appointment to show up on your google calendar automatically.</li>
  <li>A recap of the initial appointment should be entered under <strong>Activities &gt; Notes</strong>. These are not the same as Appointment notes in the left sidebar.</li>
  <li>If the lead decides they do not want to pursue solar, move the contact to Lost and provide a reason.</li>
</ul>
