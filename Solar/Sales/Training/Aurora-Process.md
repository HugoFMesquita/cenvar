## **Design Rules:**

Do not place panels in the fire set back area (Purple lines with stripes). Panels may slightly be placed in this area to fit an additional row of panels if necessary.

Design the system between 100% - 110% of the customers annual kilowatt usage on their electric bill.

Always place panels in the portrait position.

Under Irradiance place the panels from Bright Yellow to Orange. Avoid the Purple areas unless necessary.

Remove obstructions (trees) to improve the output of the system.

If any yellow panels are in your design, notify operations.
