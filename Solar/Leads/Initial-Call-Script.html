<h2>Initial Call</h2>
<p>This is __________ from Cenvar Solar. Is [<i>potential customer name</i>] available? I am calling</p>
<p>regarding your recent inquiry on our website [<i>or other prospecting means</i>]. Is now a good time?</p>
<p>[Pause]</p>
<ul>
  <li>“No” = when would be a better time? [<i>schedule a time to call back</i>]</li>
  <li>“Yes” - Fantastic!</li>
</ul>
<p>First, I’d like to thank for your inquiry into Cenvar and confirm your contact information [<i>go through name, address, email, phone, etc.</i>]</p>
<p>Before setting up an appointment, is it ok if I ask you a few questions?</p>
<p>● Do you know the approximate age of your roof?</p>
<p>● Do you have a shingle or metal roof?</p>
<p>● What are you interested in solar? (Examples if they are not sure how to respond - Reduce your electric bill, charge your EV car batteries, etc.?) [Record response]</p>
<p>● Which best describes your current level of interest? Would you say you’re gathering information, looking to get better educated, or ready for a purchase? [Record response]</p>
<p>The next step is to set up an appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Optional) Do you have a preference for an in-person visit, a video chat or only receive a quote?</p>
<p>We have times available [<i>mention dates/times</i>]. Would any of these work for your schedule?</p>
<ul>
  <li>No - suggest other times.</li>
  <li>Yes - To confirm, our sales representative, [<i>rep name</i>] will be at [<i>their address</i>] on [<i>day of week</i>], [<i>month</i>] [<i>date</i>] at [<i>time</i>].</li>
</ul>
<p>You will receive a confirmation email; please respond to that email and attach a copy of a recent electric bill. This will make sure we size your solar correctly.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering Cenvar Solar. We look forward to doing business with you.</p>
