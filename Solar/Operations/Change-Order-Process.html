<p>When Operations determines that the system sold does not fit as it was quoted, the following steps should be taken to process a change order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Operations will provide alternative design(s) in Aurora for the customer.<ul>
      <li>The design name will include labels that specify the type of change that was made.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>If the new design(s) do not change the kW output of the system, percentage of offset, or the mounting plane, it may be approved on site. Otherwise, continue with the remaining steps.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Operations will notify the Sales Specialist via notes in HubSpot that additional designs were created in Aurora due to issues with the layout and provide alternatives.<ul>
      <li><i><strong><u>Sample wording for Operations note</u></strong><u>:</u> @(Sales specialist name) Original proposed layout does not fit due to measurements in Aurora through overhead imagery not matching the roof dimensions found on site. The customer has the following options:</i>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Option 1 is labeled as (customer's preferred roof face)</i></li>
          <li><i>Option 2 is labeled as (customer's preferred roof face with additions to array#3)</i></li>
          <li><i>Option 3 is labeled as (same system size with added to East roof)</i></li>
          <li><i>Option 4 is labeled as (recommended as meets production number sold but has additions to east roof along with west roof)</i></li>
          <li style="text-align:center;"><strong>Actual options / labels may be different from the above example.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sales Specialist will go back to the customer, letting them know that the original design does not fit and provide them with options. It is imperative that the Sales Specialist communicate the changes in the design and how it could affect the performance of the system.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Once the customer decides on an alternative design, the Sales Specialist will need to create a change order in PandaDoc and have the customer sign.</li>
</ol>
